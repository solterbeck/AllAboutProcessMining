Design\/methodology\/approach The identification and discussion of the principles reflects the viewpoint, which was informed by extant literature and focus groups, including 20 BPM experts from academia and practice. Findings The authors identify ten principles which represent a set of capabilities essential for mastering contemporary and future challenges in BPM. Their antonyms signify potential roadblocks and bad practices in BPM. The authors also identify a set of open research questions that can guide future BPM research. Research limitations\/implications The findings suggest several areas of research regarding each of the identified principles of good BPM. Also, the principles themselves should be systematically and empirically examined in future studies. Practical implications The findings allow practitioners to comprehensively scope their BPM initiatives and provide a general guidance for BPM implementation. Moreover, the principles may also serve to tackle contemporary issues in other management areas. Originality\/value This is the first paper that distills principles of BPM in the sense of both good and bad practice recommendations. The value of the principles lies in providing normative advice to practitioners as well as in identifying open research areas for academia, thereby extending the reach and richness of BPM beyond its traditional frontiers.

This simplifies modeling and analysis, e.g., a process model merely describes the lifecycle of one object (e.g., a production order or an insurance claim) in terms of its activities (i.e., event types). However, in reality, there are often multiple objects of different types involved in an event. Think about filling out an electronic form referring to one order, one customer, ten items, three shipments, and one invoice. Object-centric process mining (OCPM) takes a more holistic and more comprehensive approach to process analysis and improvement by considering multiple object types and events that involve any number of objects. This paper introduces object-centric event data (OCED) and shows how these can be used to discover, analyze, and improve the fabric of real-life, highly intertwined processes. This tutorial-style paper presents the basic concepts, object-centric process-mining techniques, examples, and formalizes OCED. Fully embracing object centricity provides organizations with a \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d view of their processes, showing how they interact with each other, and where the root causes of performance and compliance problems lie.","Date":"2023-06-13","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-07-04 14:01:53","Pages":"2691","NumPages":null,"Issue":"12","Volume":"11","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":"Mathematics","ShortTitle":"Object-Centric Process Mining","Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\RBAJM3XF\\mathematics-11-02691-v2.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Object-centric Process Mining","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"2EPFMFNB","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"Berti, Alessandro; Park, Gyunam; Rafiei, Majid; Van Der Aalst, Wil M.

Organizations can gain various insights into their business processes by using process mining techniques. Such techniques use event logs extracted from relational databases supporting the business process as input. However, extracting event logs is challenging due to the size of the data, and it remains ad-hoc. Existing commercial tools partly support the extraction of event logs, but they are proprietary and focus on the mainstream processes such as Purchase-To-Pay (P2P) and Order-To-Cash (O2C). Moreover, the extracted event logs suffer from well-known deficiency, convergence, and divergence issues. For example, due to convergence events are unintentionally duplicated causing unreliable or confusing performance diagnostics. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract event logs while avoiding the aforementioned issues. More in detail, we extract object-centric event logs by using an abstraction layer of the database, called Graph of Relationships (GoRs), designing blueprints with domain knowledge, and converting the database and blueprint into object-centric event logs.We fully implemented the proposed approach, which can extract object-centric event logs from SAP ERP systems, and evaluate the utility and scalability of the proposed approach.

Such discovered Petri nets capture the process behaviour observed in a log but do not provide insights on the likelihood of behaviour: the stochastic perspective. A stochastic Petri net extends a Petri net to explicitly encode the occurrence probabilities of transitions. However, in a real-life processes, the probability of a trace may depend on data variables: e.g., a higher requested loan amount will trigger additional checks. Such dependencies are not described by current stochastic Petri nets and corresponding stochastic process mining techniques. We extend stochastic Petri nets with data-dependent transition weights and provide a technique for learning them from event logs. We discuss how to evaluate the quality of these discovered models by deriving a stochastic data-aware conformance checking technique. The implementations are available in ProM, and we show on real-life event logs that the discovery technique is competitive with existing stochastic process discovery approaches, and that new types of stochastic data-based insights can be derived.","Date":"2023","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-06-15 20:46:41","Pages":"77-98","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":"13929","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","Place":"Cham","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/978-3-031-33620-1_5","ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science DOI: 10.1007\/978-3-031-33620-1_5","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\E8J9KMLF\\Mannhardt et al. - 2023 - Modelling Data-Aware Stochastic Processes - Discov.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Conformance Checking; Process Mining; Discovery; Stochastic","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":"Gomes, Luis; Lorenz, Robert","SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"ZGZ552Z2","ItemType":"conferencePaper","PublicationYear":2015.0,"Author":"Heymann, Sascha; Jasperneite, J\u00fcrgen; Schr\u00f6ck, Sebastian; Fay, Alexander","Title":"Beschreibung von Produktionstprozessen in modularisierten Produktionsanlagen f\u00fcr Industrie 4.0","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":"10.24406\/publica-fhg-388528","Url":"https:\/\/publica.fraunhofer.de\/entities\/publication\/ca9ef9b7-ca35-43df-8ed3-a2f2226a4d76\/details","AbstractNote":"In diesen Beitrag wird der Einsatz der formalisierten Prozessbeschreibung (FPB) am Beispiel einer modularisierten Produktionsanlage gezeigt.

Therefore, the amount of data being stored about process executions is rapidly growing. Today\u2019s main innovations are intelligently exploiting the data and turning data into real value. Process mining appears to leverage execution data to analyze the business processes executed on information systems. Existing process mining techniques make a fundamental assumption about processes. Process models and event logs assume the presence of a well-defined case notion. This implies that each event refers to a case and that the model describes the life-cycle of cases. This assumption is consistent with case-centric information systems, e.g., Workflow Management (WFM) systems. However, most information systems one encounters in enterprises nowadays are artifact-centric (or data-centric), e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which do not assume a case notion in their business processes. Such differences lead to problems when applying existing process mining techniques, e.g., it is difficult to identify the case notion for the whole process, and the many-to-many relations cannot be well described. In order to solve these problems, we propose a series of process mining techniques in this thesis, such as a novel log format named eXtensible Object-Centric (XOC) to organize the data generated by artifact-centric information systems and a novel modeling language which combines data\/object modeling languages (ER, UML, or ORM) and declarative languages (Declare). Besides, we propose approaches to automatically discover OCBC models from XOC logs, to check conformance and to analyze the performance. In summary, this thesis proposes new process mining techniques to analyze the data from artifact-centric information systems and the results derived by these techniques provide insights to the process owners. For instance, the discovered process models present behavioral and data perspectives to reveal the real execution of business processes. By checking conformance, the deviating behaviors are detected. Using performance analysis techniques, the bottlenecks are shown and highlighted in the models.

Such insights are reliably interpreted by process analysts in the context of a model with formal semantics. Existing techniques for performance analysis assume that a single case notion exists in a business process (e.g., a patient in healthcare process). However, in reality, different objects might interact (e.g., order, item, delivery, and invoice in an O2C process). In such a setting, traditional techniques may yield misleading or even incorrect insights on performance metrics such as waiting time. More importantly, by considering the interaction between objects, we can define object-centric performance metrics such as synchronization time, pooling time, and lagging time. In this work, we propose a novel approach to performance analysis considering multiple case notions by using object-centric Petri nets as formal representations of business processes. The proposed approach correctly computes existing performance metrics, while supporting the derivation of newly-introduced object-centric performance metrics. We have implemented the approach as a web application and conducted a case study based on a real-life loan application process.","Date":"2022","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-05-26 08:33:48","Pages":"281-292","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":"13607","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":"OPerA","Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"DOI: 10.1007\/978-3-031-17995-2_20 arXiv:2204.10662 [cs]","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\YJYVLCC8\\2204.html; D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\IH3MQXY8\\Park et al. - 2022 - OPerA Object-Centric Performance Analysis.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Object-centric Process Mining; Petri Nets","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"T58UM7RC","ItemType":"preprint","PublicationYear":2020.0,"Author":"van der Aalst, Wil M.

These case identifiers are used to correlate events, and the resulting discovered Petri net aims to describe the life-cycle of individual cases. In reality, there is not one possible case notion, but multiple intertwined case notions. For example, events may refer to mixtures of orders, items, packages, customers, and products. A package may refer to multiple items, multiple products, one order, and one customer. Therefore, we need to assume that each event refers to a collection of objects, each having a type (instead of a single case identifier). Such object-centric event logs are closer to data in real-life information systems. From an object-centric event log, we want to discover an object-centric Petri net with places that correspond to object types and transitions that may consume and produce collections of objects of different types. Object-centric Petri nets visualize the complex relationships among objects from different types. This paper discusses a novel process discovery approach implemented in PM4Py. As will be demonstrated, it is indeed feasible to discover holistic process models that can be used to drill-down into specific viewpoints if needed.","Date":"2020-10-05","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2024-02-05 05:36:06","AccessDate":"2023-05-25 16:56:41","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"arXiv","Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.medra.org\/servlet\/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&doi=10.3233\/FI-2020-1946","ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"arXiv:2010.02047 [cs]","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\2VQK5V58\\van der Aalst and Berti - 2020 - Discovering Object-Centric Petri Nets.pdf; D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\IEYFQVFL\\2010.html","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Object-centric Process Mining; Petri Nets","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":"arXiv:2010.02047","Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"6QIRDY2B","ItemType":"bookSection","PublicationYear":2010.0,"Author":"van der Aalst, Wil M.

Simulation has been successfully applied in many disciplines and is considered to be a relevant and highly applicable tool in Business Process Management (BPM). Unfortunately, in reality the use of simulation is limited. Few organizations actively use simulation. Even organizations that purchase simulation software (stand-alone or embedded in some BPM suite), typically fail to use it continuously over an extended period. This keynote paper highlights some of the problems causing the limited adoption of simulation. For example, simulation models tend to oversimplify the modeling of people working part-time on a process. Also simulation studies typically focus on the steady-state behavior of business processes while managers are more interested in short-term results (a \u201cfast forward button\u201d into the future) for operational decision making. This paper will point out innovative simulation approaches leveraging on recent breakthroughs in process mining.

These so-called event logs (also called audit trails, or transaction logs) are the starting point for various discovery and analysis techniques that help to gain insight into certain characteristics of the process. In this paper we use a combination of process mining techniques to discover multiple perspectives (namely, the control-flow, data, performance, and resource perspective) of the process from historic data, and we integrate them into a comprehensive simulation model. This simulation model is represented as a colored Petri net (CPN) and can be used to analyze the process, e.g., evaluate the performance of different alternative designs. The discovery of simulation models is explained using a running example. Moreover, the approach has been applied in two case studies; the workflows in two different municipalities in the Netherlands have been analyzed using a combination of process mining and simulation. Furthermore, the quality of the CPN models generated for the running example and the two case studies has been evaluated by comparing the original logs with the logs of the generated models.

Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.

This digital tool completely changed engineering in all phases of the project life cycle since its first use in 2015. Its unique capacity is to \u2018Engineer with the Human Factor in the loop\u2019 independent if this Human Factor is the client, designer, fabricator, marine warranty surveyor or the offshore operator.             In the conventional engineering tools the Human Factor cannot be included and in the conventional engineering process the preparation is done by engineers without much involvement of the operators. It is as if engineering and execution are separate worlds.

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects.

In recent years, the extensive instrumentation of machines and the advancements in Information Communication Technologies are re-shaping the role of assets in our industrial systems. An emerging concept here is that of \u2018social assets\u2019: assets that collaborate with each other in order to improve system optimisation. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are formed by embedding the assets with computers, or microcontrollers, which run real-time decision-making algorithms over the data originating from the asset. These are known as the \u2018Digital Twins\u2019 of the assets, and form the backbone of social assets. It is essential to have an architecture which enables a seamless integration of these technological advances for an industry. This paper proposes a Multi Agent System (MAS) architecture for collaborative learning, and presents the findings of an implementation of this architecture for a prognostics problem. Collaboration among assets is performed by calculating inter-asset similarity during operating condition to identify \u2018friends\u2019 and sharing operational data within these clusters of friends. The architecture described in this paper also presents a generic model for the Digital Twins of assets. Prognostics is demonstrated for the C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation simulated data-set (Saxena and Goebel (2008)).

Connected micro smart factories in factory-as-a-service system with these new manufacturing paradigms and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are inefficient in terms of cost and production. To solve these problems, a digital twin, which uses a digital representation of a process, with the same configuration of manufacturing elements, synchronized information, and functional units, was designed and implemented. The digital twin utilizes the latest information from the Internet to gather data from IIoT devices and interoperates in a variety of applications. In addition, it derives the components of a detailed design of the digital twin application, to which it performs procedure definition. This research differs from other digital twin studies that concentrate on the prognostic health management of only a single machine. This study could help managers organize the benefits of utilization through a digital twin based on a hierarchy as they could receive real-time monitoring of the present, tracking information from the past, and operational decision-making support for the future. In addition, the proposed application reduces the cost and production inefficiencies, ultimately resulting in the efficient operation of a manufacturing system.

With the advent of CAD\/CAE\/CAM Softwares and high power computers, facility layout can be planned and engineered from a remote location. Manufacturing facilities undergo a lot of changes due to change in customer requirements, government regulations, safety standards, the complexity of products and process improvisation. It becomes indispensable to keep manufacturing facility digitally updated for upfront simulations and to capture facility change requirements caused by product variations. In the current methodology, it takes a significant amount of time and cost to keep manufacturing facility digitally updated. Digital Twin is an emerging technology that nowadays almost all consumer goods, airplanes, manufacturing plants, oil refineries, transportation networks, and even entire cities are having the potential to have Digital Twin of its own. This paper suggesting a methodology to apply Digital Twin to a manufacturing facility for keeping the model updated and simulated in real time. Real Time Location Sensing (RTLS) technology with transmitter tags, receiver nodes, and gateways (IOT) deployed at the facility. Manage transformation matrix for each asset in the Digital manufacturing facility at PLM\/CAD software. The Discrete Event Simulation tool is integrated into PLM to run model directly from PLM in real time. Tags attached to each physical asset sends a signal to the receiver when asset movement or orientation occurs at the physical facility, Tags attached to each asset sends a signal to the receiver. The receiver sends pre-processed information to a gateway which acts as an edge device to process and converts those signals as transformation matric which gets synced to PLM system. Now digital manufacturing facility is up-to-date. Any facility change requirement can do in this digital model and simulated in real time for the quickest decision. The time factor has been compared with this new digital twin methodology and conventional methodology and discussed the results. \u00a9 BEIESP.","Date":"2019-05","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-05-04","Pages":"63-68","NumPages":null,"Issue":"1","Volume":"8","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":"https:\/\/www.scopus.com\/record\/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068437190&origin=inward&txGid=4c0e91d75419c0e2684cfb6605c5ce94","ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\4JCK3FH4\\Vijayakumar et al. - 2019 - Digital twin for factory system simulation.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Digital Twin; Simulation; Internet of Things","AutomaticTags":"\u26d4 No DOI found","Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"EBY5QAEU","ItemType":"conferencePaper","PublicationYear":2017.0,"Author":"Stachowski, T.-H.; Kjeilen, H.","Title":"Holistic ship design - How to utilise a digital twin in concept design through basic and detailed design","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":"978-1-909024-67-0","ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"https:\/\/f.hubspotusercontent10.net\/hubfs\/663810\/Digitread%20Assets\/ICCAS_finalDraft_2017Format2.pdf","AbstractNote":"People have been designing and building ships successfully for hundreds of years - why change now?

In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today\u2019s simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems.

Monitoring and improvement in the injection molding industry are usually performed separately in each stage, i.e. mold design, mold making and injection molding process. However, in order to make a breakthrough and survive in the industrial revolution, all the stages in injection molding need to be linked and communicated with each other. Any changes in one stage will cause a certain effect in other stage because there is a correlation between each other. Hence, the simulation should not only based on the input of historical data, but it also needs to include the current condition of equipment and prediction of future events in other stages to make the responsive decision. This can be achieved by implementing the concept of Digital Twin that models the entire process as a virtual model and enables bidirectional control with the physical process. This paper presented types of data and technology required to build the Digital Twin for the injection molding industry. The concept includes Digital Twin of each stage and integration of these Digital Twin model as a thoroughgoing model of the injection molding industry.

Along with the advances in new generation information technologies, smart manufacturing is becoming the focus of global manufacturing transformation. Considering the competitive nature of industry, it requires manufacturers to implement new methodologies. Realistic virtual models mirroring the real world are becoming essential to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. In this paper model conceptualization, representation, and implementation of the digital twin is presented, on the real use case of manufacturing industry and in the cyber physical environment. A novel CPS architecture for real time visualization of complex industrial process is proposed. It essentially considers the Simulation technological pillar of Industry 4.0. The results from a real industrial environment show good performances in terms of real time behaviour, virtual reality and WebGL CPS visualization features, usability and readability.

This led to an emergence of a concept of digital twin, which is a realistic virtual copy of a physical object. Digital twin will be the key technology in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and its market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Nevertheless, digital twin is still relatively a new concept that people have different perspectives on its requirements, capabilities, and limitations. To better understand an effect of digital twin\u2019s operations, mitigate complexity of capturing dynamics of physical phenomena, and improve analysis and predictability, it is important to have a development tool with a strong semantic foundation that can accurately model, simulate, and synthesise the digital twin. This paper reviews current state-of-art on tools and developments of digital twin in manufacturing and discusses potential design challenges.

Skin Model Shapes use discrete surface representation schemes, such as meshes and point clouds, to represent surfaces, which makes them enablers to perform an accurate tolerance analysis and surface inspection. However, online inspection of manufactured parts through use of Skin Model Shapes has not been extensively studied. Moreover, the existing geometric variation inspection techniques do not detect unfamiliar changes within tolerance, which could be the precursors to the onset of the manufacturing of out of tolerance part. To detect the unfamiliar changes, as anomalies, and categorize them as systematic and random variations, some unique surface characteristics can be extracted and studied. Random surface deviations exhibit narrow normal distributions, and systematic deviations, on the other hand, exhibit wide, skewed, and multimodal distributions. Using those surface characteristics as key traits, machine learning classifiers can be used to classify deviations into systematic and random variations. To illustrate the method, multiple samples from a truck component manufacturing line were scanned and the collected 3D point cloud data was used to extract features. A prediction score of 97\u2013100% can be achieved by decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, and ensemble classifiers. The purposed approach is expected to extend the existing online inspection approaches and applications of Skin Model Shapes in quality control.

However, the woods are not only an economic resource, but also a public good with significant cultural and ecological importance. This results in numerous boundary conditions and regulations, which aim at ensuring sustainable use. In combination with a high degree of division of labor and highly decentralized work processes within the sector, this results in highly complex value-added chains with a large number of stakeholders. Numerous innovative technological solutions exist, that aim at solving individual problems, yet, an overarching approach and infrastructure allowing for the realization of integrated value added networks is still missing. Based on the manufacturing industries experience with Industry 4.0, we present a new concept Forestry 4.0. Its technical realization involves connecting wood resources, data sets, existing and new hard- and software components as well as stakeholders into a novel Internet of Things, Services, and People in forestry. Its nodes are Digital Twins which describe their corresponding real world artifacts, predict control their behavior, and integrate them into surrounding systems processes. In this way, Forestry 4.0 aims at integrating currently isolated artifacts and at revealing the potential of new technological solutions and business models. Finally, we show first steps of implementing this concept within a multidomain simulation system and present a strategy for the concepts dissemination into the forestry sector.

Such logs allow process mining techniques to handle multi-object processes in an appropriate manner. However, event data is often not yet available in this new format, but is rather captured in the form of classical, \u201cflat\u201d event logs. This flat representation obscures the true interrelations that exist between different objects and associated events, causing issues such as the well-known convergence and divergence of event data. This situation calls for support to transform classical event logs into object-centric counterparts. Such a transformation is far from straightforward, though, given that the information required for object-centric logs, such as explicitly indicated object types, identifiers, and properties, is not readily available in flat logs. In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically uncovers object-related information in flat event data and uses this information to transform the flat data into an object-centric event log according to the OCEL format. We achieve this by combining the semantic analysis of textual attributes with data profiling and control-flow-based relation extraction techniques. We demonstrate our approach\u2019s efficacy through evaluation experiments and highlight its usefulness by applying it to real-life event logs in order to mitigate the quality issues caused by their flat representation.

This does require that all the information of event\/object attributes and their values are stored within logs including attributes that have a list of values or attributes with values that change over time. It also requires that attributes can unambiguously be linked to an object, an event or both. As such, object-centric event logs are an interesting development in process mining as they support the presence of multiple types of objects. First, this paper shows that the current object-centric event log formats do not support the aforementioned aspects to their full potential since the possibility to support dynamic object attributes (attributes with changing values) is not supported by existing formats. Next, this paper introduces a novel enriched object-centric event log format tackling the aforementioned issues alongside an algorithm that automatically translates XES logs to this Data-aware OCEL (DOCEL) format.

An essential requirement is that every event in the log must be associated with a unique case identifier (e.g., the order ID of an order-to-cash process). In reality, however, this case identifier may not always be present, especially when logs are acquired from different systems or extracted from non-process-aware information systems. In such settings, the event log needs to be pre-processed by grouping events into cases \u2014 an operation known as event correlation. Existing techniques for correlating events have worked with assumptions to make the problem tractable: some assume the generative processes to be acyclic, while others require heuristic information or user input. Moreover, they abstract the log to activities and timestamps, and miss the opportunity to use data attributes. In this paper, we lift these assumptions and propose a new technique called EC-SA-Data based on probabilistic optimization. The technique takes as inputs a sequence of timestamped events (the log without case IDs), a process model describing the underlying business process, and constraints over the event attributes. Our approach returns an event log in which every event is associated with a case identifier. The technique allows users to flexibly incorporate rules on process knowledge and data constraints. The approach minimizes the misalignment between the generated log and the input process model, maximizes the support of the given data constraints over the correlated log, and the variance between activity durations across cases. Our experiments with various real-life datasets show the advantages of our approach over the state of the art.

The term digital twins refers to the development of virtual models of processes, products or services that allow the simulation of system behavior and the early detection of problems before the real system exists. Simulations have been state of the art for a long time, but with the service-oriented possibilities of the Internet a new quality of simulation results. In the meantime, it has become possible, for example, to configure a virtual computer on the Internet and run algorithms on it without this computer in fact existing, see e.g. AWS (AMAZON web services).

Digital Twins stand for a specific engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the concept of \u2018normality\u2019 or \u2018health,\u2019 as a set of patterns that are regular for a particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the \u2018asymptomatic ill\u2019 and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data privacy.

The interface protocol is set to construct an information model, which can be used for the virtual-real interaction between the simulation model and the physical system. Based on the digital twin model, probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) is performed to generate a collision-free path and control the robot to accomplish the assembly mission.

Within Industry 4.0, the amount of digital product information generated and collected over the entire lifecycle has been growing. Current information and communication technologies, including data storage, data processing, and wireless data transmission, may be leveraged to digitally mirror the lifecycle of a corresponding physical product with increasing level of detail. A DT creates a link between physical products and their virtual models with more comprehensive data and accumulation of knowledge. Therefore, a DT may be applied to enhance simulation, traceability and to support the offering of value-added services along the lifecycle. However, the definition of a DT and its requirements are not yet fully established. The characteristics a DT model should possess to be widely used in manufacturing remains an open question in the literature. The concept is still broad and dependent on the lifecycle stage and industry sector of application. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose an initial synthesis of DT requirements based on a literature review and industry interviews. The literature review focuses on the content analysis of papers published from 2010 to 2018 and indexed in the ISI Web of Science database. The interviews were conducted with industry representatives in Brazil. The results show that DT requirements are related to real-time data, integration, and fidelity. Besides, it shows that industry requirements are close to literature and the actual implementation of DT is the future of research in this field.

ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system\u2019s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0\u20131 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.

Combining current research results from different disciplines with industrial experience, this paper dares to think out of the box and look beyond the limits of traditional safety assurance. It structures upcoming challenges posed by the emergence of open systems of systems, tries to shift existing paradigms to meet those new challenges, and proposes an abstract conceptual framework building on comprehensive interlinked multi-concern runtime models for dynamically assuring the safety as well as other properties of open systems of systems. As there currently is no comprehensive realization of the framework, we discuss what kind of approaches could fit into which parts of the framework and exemplify this for the case of conditional safety certificates.

It is therefore relevant to assess the applicability of FEA open software to simulate 2D heat transfer in metal sheet laser cuts. Application of open source code (e.g. FreeFem++, FEniCS, MOOSE) makes possible additional scenarios (e.g. parallel, CUDA, etc.), with lower costs. However, a precise assessment is required on the scenarios in which open software can be a sound alternative to a commercial one. This article contributes in this regard, by presenting a comparison of the aforementioned freeware FEM software for the simulation of heat transfer in thin (i.e. 2D) sheets, subject to a gliding laser point source. We use the commercial ABAQUS software as the reference to compare such open software. A convective linear thin sheet heat transfer model, with and without material removal is used. This article does not intend a full design of computer experiments. Our partial assessment shows that the thin sheet approximation turns to be adequate in terms of the relative error for linear alumina sheets. Under mesh resolutions better than 10\u22125  m , the open and reference software temperature differ in at most 1 %  of the temperature prediction. Ongoing work includes adaptive re-meshing, nonlinearities, sheet stress analysis and Mach (also called \u2018relativistic\u2019) effects.

This work analyses process mining's application for sustainability by conducting two consecutive literature studies-the first on the broad domain of sustainability, and the second on the circular economy, a widely accepted approach for pursuing sustainability. Results show the potential of process mining for assessing and analysing sustainability in business processes, allowing for data-driven decision support and targeted improvement. They also show that process mining has yet to reach the sustainability domain. To enable collaboration between both communities, we present PM4S, a framework for applying process mining for sustainability.

This paper presents a novel physics-informed optimization approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) to generate digital process twins (DPTs). The utility of the DPT approach is demonstrated for the case of finish machining of aerospace components made from gamma titanium aluminide alloy (\u03b3-TiAl). This particular component has been plagued with persistent quality defects, including surface and sub-surface cracks, which adversely affect resource efficiency. Previous process improvement efforts have been restricted to anecdotal post-mortem investigation and empirical modeling, which fail to address the fundamental issue of how and when cracks occur during cutting. In this work, the integration of in-situ process characterization with modular physics-based models is presented, and machine learning algorithms are used to create a DPT capable of reducing environmental and energy impacts while significantly increasing yield and profitability. Based on the preliminary results presented here, an improvement in the overall embodied energy efficiency of over 84%, 93% in process queuing time, 2% in scrap cost, and 93% in queuing cost has been realized for \u03b3-TiAl machining using our novel approach.","Date":"2021-06-21","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":null,"Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":"4","Volume":"144","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":"DOI: 10.1115\/msec2021-63460 MAG ID: 3190617939 S2ID: 989d13351f3036716474c0ab6be344304f829051","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":null,"LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":null,"AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"CXJRUIM8","ItemType":"conferencePaper","PublicationYear":2019.0,"Author":"Mayes, Alexander; Heffernan, Julieanne; Jauriqui, Leanne; Livings, Richard; Biedermann, Eric; Aldrin, John C.; Goodlet, Brent R.; Mazdiyasni, Siamack","Title":"Process compensated resonance testing (PCRT) inversion for material characterization and digital twin calibration","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":"10.1063\/1.5099723","Url":"https:\/\/pubs.aip.org\/aip\/acp\/article\/888035","AbstractNote":"The Digital Twin paradigm is based on the idea that a component\u2019s serviceable life and performance can be better predicted and monitored by creating a faithful virtual counterpart of a real component, which in turn leads to improvements in end-product safety and cost. Such a model requires accurate inputs for the initial material state of the part as well as in-service loads and damage states throughout its service life. The resonance frequencies of a part correlate to a part\u2019s material state and damage state. Similarly, changes in resonance frequencies correlate to changes in the part\u2019s material state resulting from in-service loads and damage. Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) leverages these physical relationships to perform nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and material characterization using the measured resonance frequencies of a component. Prior work has established techniques for modeling the effects of material property variation, crystal orientation, and damage states on resonance, as well as quantifying uncertainty propagation from model inputs to outputs. This study examines the use of PCRT model inversion to obtain material properties and calibrate digital twins of real components. Digital twin instances were first created for a population of single crystal Nickel-base superalloy samples using dimension and mass measurements. Then, after collecting resonance spectra from the physical counterparts, model inversion techniques were employed to estimate elastic properties and crystal orientation for each part. The digital twins were then calibrated with the model inversion output. These digital twins were subsequently validated by comparing the inversion results to resonance and x-ray diffraction measurements on a statistically significant population of physical specimens. The results highlight the value of part-specific material properties for digital twin performance, as well as the ability of PCRT to evaluate and improve digital twin fidelity.

The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi.

Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.

Exponential advances in technology, increased consumer power and sharpened competition imply that companies are facing the menace of commoditization. To sustainably succeed in the market, obsolete business models have to be adapted and new business models can be developed. Differentiation and unique selling propositions through innovation as well as holistic stakeholder engagement help companies to master the transformation. To enable companies and start-ups facing the implications of digital change, a tool was created and designed specifically for this demand: the Business Model Builder. This paper investigates the process of transforming the Business Model Builder into a software-supported digitized version. The digital twin allows companies to simulate the iterative adjustment of business models to constantly changing market conditions as well as customer needs on an ongoing basis. The user can modify individual variables, understand interdependencies and see the impact on the result of the business case, i.e. earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or economic value added (EVA). The simulation of a business models accordingly provides the opportunity to generate a dynamic view of the business model where any changes of input variables are considered in the result, the business case. Thus, functionality, feasibility and profitability of a business model can be reviewed, tested and validated in the digital simulation tool.

To face this challenge one solution is a Digital Twin, which can be used to reduce the complexity and time of reconfiguration by early detection of design or process sequence errors of the system with a cross-domain simulation. For engineering the Digital Twin and systemically synchronizing the data of mechatronic components in the interdisciplinary engineering models of a Digital Twin during the life cycle of manufacturing automation systems, this paper presents a concept for the engineering of a Digital Twin based on model integration in a PLM IT-Platform and an Anchor-Point method to systematically detect variances of the mechatronic data structure between the digital models and the physical system. The data of a mechatronic component from interdisciplinary domains, developed by the corresponding engineering tools are referred to as anchor points. This paper analyses domain-specific challenges in automation software-code to develop an assistance system for rule-based consistency check and for synchronizing the engineering models of the Digital Twin of the manufacturing automation system based on the Anchor-Point method.

The advent of simulation-based fatigue life prediction tools opens a path to Digital Twin based solutions for tracking damage, and for gaining control over vehicle reliability. An incremental damage updating feature has now been implemented in the Endurica CL fatigue solver with the aim of supporting such applications for elastomer components. The incremental updating feature is demonstrated via the example of a simple transmission mount component. The damage state of the mount is computed as it progresses towards failure under a series of typical loading histories. The incremental updating feature enables both more realism in anticipating maintenance demands, and better planning of availability\/readiness for specific mission demands.

Over the years more and more industries have adopted the digital twin paradigm to improve traceability, maintenance, and analytics allowing for improved sustainment of the asset or equipment while reducing various risks identified during life cycle management. It has been found that collectively, the digital twin concept improves the overall net present value of an asset. The oil and gas industry has slowly been adopting the digital twin paradigm of asset life cycle management over the past two decades with the focus on facilities. Recently, field trials were completed to test and evaluate workflows and sensor platforms for the creation of a digital twin for pipelines. The trials resulted in highly accurate pipeline centerlines, weld locations, Depth to Cover (DoC) and ditch geometry capture in digital formats. This paper describes the methodologies used, and the results of an actual construction field trial with a comparison to traditional data collection methods for these attributes. The value of creating a pipeline digital twin during pipeline construction in near-real-time is discussed with an emphasis on the potential benefits to life cycle management and pipeline integrity.

From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle. Finally, an industrial robot application is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model framework.

This investigation includes transient flow of the liquid \u2013 blood and dynamics of zones of shear stress at vessels. The main goal of the research is obtaining of hemodynamic and shear stress for creating the digital twin of coronary heart vessels. The results were obtained for low Reynolds numbers about 20 of three-dimensional laminar flow. With this Reynolds number the turbulent flow of the blood is modelled by Realizable k-\u03b5 model, and SST models to the narrowing, expansions, and blocks inside the vessels. Loads caused by the additional energy consumption because of the turbulent flow of the blood (increase in arterial blood pressure) have been analyzed. A two-dimensional model of a separated vessel with fixed blood back-flow prevention is developed. Presence of a turbulent flow core is discovered. By the means of stress-strain properties of the model, visual representation of the wearing process of the blood back-flow preventer, and heart diseases progression is obtained.

By acquiring, processing and acting upon various kinds of relevant context information, smart automated manufacturing systems can make well-informed decisions to adapt and optimize their production processes at runtime. To manage this complexity, the manufacturing world is proposing the 'Digital Twin' model to represent physical products in the real space and their virtual counterparts in the virtual space, with data connections to tie the virtual and real products together for an augmented view of the manufacturing workflow. The benefits of such representations are simplified process simulations and efficiency optimizations, predictions, early warnings, etc. However, the robustness and fidelity of digital twins are a critical concern, especially when independently developed production systems and corresponding digital twins interfere with one another in a manufacturing workflow and jeopardize the proper behavior of production systems. We therefore evaluate the addition of safeguards to digital twins for smart cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) in an Industry 4.0 manufacturing workflow in the form of feature toggles that are managed at runtime by software circuit breakers. Our evaluation shows how these improvements can increase the robustness of interacting digital twins by avoiding local errors from cascading through the distributed production or manufacturing workflow.

Furthermore it allows to use these models with up-to-date data to prepare maintenance procedures or to simulate the effects of plant reconfigurations before they are applied.

Access to this high-dimensional state of a DT is the key for various analysis and visualization methods presented in this paper. We introduce a generic formalism of state space for DTs and utilize it in an application scenario for automated driving. Throughout this example, methods for state logging and replays, data analysis, and visualization within 3D simulation frameworks are presented. Clear definitions for state variables, vectors, trajectories, and time series help slicing the DTs' state spaces of enormous dimensionality. The presented methodology does not only support the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous driving, but is also the basis for further use cases of DTs involving optimization, mental models, and decision support systems.

Energy saving of IRs therefore is in great demand for environment protection and enterprise cost reduction, and the energy modeling of IRs is the basis to achieve such goal. In this paper, a novel energy modeling method of IRs based on digital twin is proposed and the system framework is established, which mainly includes the physics-based energy model of the physical IRs, the 3D virtual robot model used to visualize and simulate on the energy consumption of IRs, the digital twin data and the ontology-based unified digitized description model for mapping the virtual model to the corresponding physical energy model. Furthermore, the mapping relation between the physical data and ontology attributes is established to enable the interaction between the physical space and the cyber space of the whole system. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a case study, and the results show that the digital twin-based energy modeling method can be efficiently used for the simulation and prediction of the energy consumption of IRs.

First, they have only limited knowledge about the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed. Second, the constituent systems which will compose the SoS might not be known a priori (at design-time) or their availability (at run-time) is affected by dynamic factors, due to the openness of the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to deal with uncertainty in the design of an SoS architecture on the IoT. To tackle this challenging issue, this paper addresses the notion of uncertainty due to partial information in SoS and proposes an enhanced SoS Architecture Description language (SosADL) for expressing SoS architectures on the IoT under uncertainty. The core SosADL is extended with concurrent constraints and the concept of digital twins coupling the physical and virtual worlds. This novel approach is supported by an integrated toolset, the SosADL Studio. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness in an SoS architecture for platooning of self-driving vehicles.

The idea is that by performing Big data analytics on the past process data we can model what is (statistically analyzed) usual\/normal for a selected period and check the variations from that model in the real-time (as Six Sigma requires). Additionally, these data-driven models can support the root- cause analysis that should provide insights what can be eliminated as a waste in the process (as Lean requires). However, due to the above mentioned variety and volume of data, the analytics must be a) robust - dealing with differences efficiently and b) scalable - realized in an extremely parallel way. We propose a novel method for process control that uses big data analytics approaches to deal with the multidimensionality and the large size of the process space. In order to realize this idea we develop a new concept of self- aware digital twins which are able to reason about own behaviour and react if needed. Indeed, we revolutionize the concept of digital twins by extending their \"virtual replica\" (of physical objects) nature into \"digital self-awareness\" of physical objects (assets, systems), leading to the new generation of digital twins, so called self-aware DTs, which can \"reasons\" about the behaviour of an object (and not only mimic it) and actively participate in its improvement. We present the outcomes from the case study related to 3D laser cutting process.

Determining machinery's cost characteristics on the conceive step of their lifecycle is the most efficient if it's based on probabilistic approach. On the next steps of design process, such as concept design and detailed design, a designed construction's price should be estimated basing on its informational (parametric) complexity indexes. This price is to be compared with earlier estimated approximate parameters. The most efficient way of using presented approach is making it a part of CAx system (first of all, such systems as MCAD and EDA). It may be applied as a part of invariant subsystem of technical and economic parameters for the computer-aided account facilities and for simulation of processes (CAE, CAA). The most appropriate way of organizing design and development processes is to use AGILE ideology. This approach gives a possibility to create an integral system of creating digital twins that is useable on any step of product's lifecycle.

Simulation-based DTs (SBDTs) are those based on online first-principles simulation models. In these systems, model parameter estimation techniques keep an online plant simulator in the same state as the targeted device or process. As a result, non-measured information of the current state of the plant can be obtained from the model. SBDTs can be used for a number of important applications and they have various advantages compared to DTs based on data-driven models. However, wider industrial adoption of SBDTs is hindered by laborious development of their underlying first-principles simulation model as well as by a lack of integrated lifecycle-wide implementation methods and simulation architectures. This paper focuses on applying previously presented methods for reducing implementation effort of SBDTs. Firstly, laborious simulation model development is tackled by applying an automatic model generation method. Secondly, an integrated implementation methodology of a lifecycle-wide online simulation architecture is followed for developing the SBDT. A SBDT of a laboratory-scale process is implemented to demonstrate the proposed method. The results show a higher level of fidelity compared to previous publications.

Most existing railway stations in the UK is historic and have been operated for many years. Maintenance and reconstruction are common concerns in the public railway industry, and clusters of information pertaining to this maintenance must be managed appropriately for effective outcome. Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. This paper discusses a specific BIM application within the context of railway station buildings using a Revit-based simulation of construction work for King\u2019s Cross station in London. The paper highlights the adoption and transformation of 3D model of the King\u2019s Cross station building into a 6D building information model. The 6D model contains a time and cost schedule with carbon emissions calculation, and renovation assumptions using Revit.

Hardware-in-the-loop setups are routinely used by manufacturing companies to carry out virtual commissioning. However, manufacturing companies having online legacy production systems are still struggling to incorporate a digital twin due to the absence of verified and validated simulation models. Companies that use virtual commissioning as a part of their engineering tool chain, usually perform offline verification of the simulation model. This approach is typically based on visual inspection and is a tedious task as each aspect of the model has to be visually validated. For legacy systems, only assessing the behavior visually in the absence of updated documents can result in an incorrect simulation model, i.e. simulating incorrect behavior with respect to the specification. Due to this, such simulation models cannot be incorporated in the engineering tool chain, as the simulated results can lead to improper decisions and can even cause equipment damage. This paper presents a platform and an approach, based on model-based testing, that is a first step for manufacturing companies to incorporate a validated simulation model for existing online production systems that will serve as a digital twin.

A software platform for data aggregation and a discrete-event digital twin of the line were built entirely using open-source tools. Based on the insights gained from data collected over several days, we propose a buffering-based solution for improving the energy efficiency of the line, and evaluate its impact using simulations of the digital twin. The results show that a 2.7x reduction in the energy consumption is possible via buffer insertion without significantly affecting line throughput.

It is thought that VR is mainly used in entertainment purposes, but it is being used already for many years in different industries, and now with easier access to the hardware it became a helpful and accessible tool that could be used and developed in any field of human activities. In manufacturing, immersive technologies are mainly used nowadays for the visualisation of processes and products combining those visuals into  the factory Digital Twin (DT) which is possible to view from the inside look. This feature is already being used in several manufacturing simulation tools, which enable to view onto industrial line \/ robotic cells via Virtual Reality glasses. However, the potential of using simulations with VR in manufacturing is not fully uncovered. The main aim of this, industrial robotics targeted research is to enable besides simulation also universal control algorithms through Virtual Reality experience, produced by game engine Unity3D, which can be easily modified for a wide range of industrial equipment. The primary outcome of this work is the development of the synchro-nisation model of real and virtual industrial robots and experimental testing the developed model in Virtual Reality and shop floor labs.

Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a \"digital twin\" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.

Several in-use bridges lack an appropriate regular maintenance solution, leading to extra cost during the operation stage. This paper proposes a new generation of the bridge maintenance system by using a digital twin model concept for more reliable decision-making. A detailed solution is proposed in this work to enhance the bridge maintenance process using a parallel solution: a maintenance information management system based on a 3D information model in conjunction with a digital inspection system using image processing. Three-dimensional digital models are required to utilise information from the entire lifecycle of a project, including design and construction, operation, and maintenance, by continuously exchanging and updating data from each stakeholder. For the maintenance of prestressed concrete bridges, the twin models are defined and their uses are presented.

In next-generation manufacturing, the digital twin (DT) has been proposed as a new concept and simulation tool for collecting and synchronizing real-world information in real time in cyber space to cope with the challenges of smart factories. Although the DT is considered a challenging technology, it is still at the conceptual stage and only a few studies have specifically discussed methods for its construction and implementation. In this study, we first explain the concept of DT and important issues involved in developing it within an IoT-aided manufacturing environment. Then, we propose a DT construction framework and scheme for inputting data derived from the IoT into a simulation model. Finally, we describe how we verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and scheme, by constructing a DT-oriented simulation model for an IoT-aided manufacturing system.","Date":"2019-01-03","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-04-21 19:26:20","Pages":"2","NumPages":null,"Issue":"1","Volume":"7","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":"Machines","ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\FWIHJ92V\\Tan et al. - 2019 - Application of IoT-Aided Simulation to Manufacturi.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Digital Twin","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"M8FTECG8","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2018.0,"Author":"Zakoldaev, D A; Gurjanov, A V; Kochubey, D R; Zharinov, I O","Title":"Application of imitation modelling means to create digital twins of the Industry 4.0 company technological equipment","PublicationTitle":"IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","ISBN":null,"ISSN":"1757-899X","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/450\/3\/032006","Url":"https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1757-899X\/450\/3\/032006","AbstractNote":"The task is being studied how to project digital twins of technological equipment in the example of remote control model computer model software realization.

While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.

In particular, with the proposed manufacturing system architecture, decision support tools can use a unified repository fed by a factory replication application, powered by data from the field, even from remote production units. Such data allow to monitor the behaviour of the digital twin of the real machine and produces a digital twin of the real product, incorporating its actual characteristics measured by means of suitable acquiring systems (in the treated example: a 3D laser scanner). Moreover, it is provided a description of the plant technological subsystems that allow to share designing and manufacturing activities across multiple similar units located in remote areas. In this context of virtual enterprise, the supply chain management results as a key factor in enabling a cooperative approach.

At the core of the concept lies the inclusion of the entire asset lifecycle. To enable all lifecycle parties to partake, the Digital Twin should provide a sharable data base. Thereby, integrity and confidentiality issues are pressing, turning security into a major requirement. However, given that the Digital Twin paradigm is still at an early stage, most works do not consider security yet. Distributed ledgers provide a novel technology for multi-party data sharing that emphasizes security features such as integrity. For this reason, we examine the applicability of distributed ledgers to secure Digital Twin data sharing. We contribute to current literature by identifying requirements for Digital Twin data sharing in order to overcome current infrastructural challenges. We furthermore propose a framework for secure Digital Twin data sharing based on Distributed Ledger Technology. A conclusive use case demonstrates requirements fulfillment and is followed by a critical discussion proposing avenues for future work.

In terms of Human-Machine Interaction, the User Interface (UI) plays the most important role as a mediator between the human and certain assistance systems. In traditional industrial environments, the UIs are usually designed to handle a unimodal input command (via touch screen, keyboard or mouse) and to present a feedback in a visual way. However, due to the nature of the tasks there is a need for the human workers to easily shift tasks and acquire new skills. For this reason, in the UI adaptation process the personal abilities and preferences of the human workers should be taken into consideration. In this paper, we present a novel reference model for multi-modal adaptive UIs for assistance systems in manufacturing processes. Our approach provides a solution framework for adaptation of assistance systems in manufacturing processes not only based on the environmental conditions, but also based on the personal characteristics and abilities of the human workers, obtained by a personalized Digital Twin.

However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be printed and the market value of all 3D printed products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy. This difficulty is attributable to a remarkable diversity in structure and properties of the printed components and susceptibility to defects. In addition, the current practice of qualifying components by prolonged trial and error with expensive printing equipment and feed stock material confine the printed products to a niche market where the high product cost and the delay in the qualification are not critical factors. Here we explain how a digital twin or a digital replica of the printing machine will reduce the number of trial and error tests to obtain desired product attributes and reduce the time required for part qualification to make the printed components cost effective. It is shown that a comprehensive digital twin of 3D printing machine consisting of mechanistic, control and statistical models of 3D printing, machine learning and big data can reduce the volume of trial and error testing, reduce defects and shorten time between the design and production.

Accordingly, analyzing the causes of waiting times of activity transitions can help analysts to identify opportunities for reducing the cycle time of a process. This paper proposes a process mining approach to decompose the waiting time observed in each activity transition in a process into multiple direct causes and to analyze the impact of each identified cause on the cycle time efficiency of the process. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach is able to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life process.","Date":"2022-12-02","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-04-21 12:52:20","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":"Why am I Waiting?","Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"arXiv","Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"arXiv:2212.01392 [cs]","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\LPS7JLE6\\Lashkevich et al. - 2022 - Why am I Waiting Data-Driven Analysis of Waiting .pdf; D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\XMHI7LG3\\2212.html","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Business Process Management","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":"arXiv:2212.01392","Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"ML96ZLHE","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"Kubrak, Kateryna; Milani, Fredrik; Nolte, Alexander","Title":"A visual approach to support process analysts in working with process improvement opportunities","PublicationTitle":"Business Process Management Journal","ISBN":null,"ISSN":"1463-7154","DOI":"10.1108\/BPMJ-10-2021-0631","Url":"https:\/\/www.emerald.com\/insight\/content\/doi\/10.1108\/BPMJ-10-2021-0631\/full\/html","AbstractNote":"Purpose  When improving business processes, process analysts can use data-driven methods, such as process mining, to identify improvement opportunities. However, despite being supported by data, process analysts decide which changes to implement. Analysts often use process visualisations to assess and determine which changes to pursue.

Design\/methodology\/approach  The study follows the design science methodology to create and evaluate an artefact for visualising identified improvement opportunities (IRVIN).  Findings  A set of principles to facilitate the visualisation of process mining outputs for analysts to work with improvement opportunities was suggested. Particularly, insights into identifying, prioritising and communicating process improvement opportunities from visual representation are outlined.

However, given the importance of digitalization and its relevance for accounting, an amalgamation of the parent research field of accounting and the subfield of accounting information systems is pivotal for continuing relevant research that is of high quality. This study empirically investigates the distance between AIS research that is included in accounting literature and AIS research that prevails in dedicated AIS research outlets.  Design\/methodology\/approach  To understand which topics define AIS research, all articles published in the two leading AIS journals since 2000 were analyzed. Based on this topical inventory, all AIS studies that were published in the top 16 accounting journals, also since 2000, are identified and categorized in terms of topic, subtopic and research methodology. Next, AIS studies published in the general accounting field and AIS studies published in the AIS field were compared in terms of topics and research methodology to gain insights into the distance between the two fields.  Findings  The coverage of AIS topics in accounting journals is, to no small extent, concentrated around the topics \u201cinformation disclosure\u201d, \u201cnetwork technologies\u201d and \u201caudit and control\u201d. Other AIS topics remain underrepresented. A possible explanation might be the focus on archival studies in accounting outlets, but other elements might play a role. The findings suggest that there is only a partial overlap between the parent accounting research field and the AIS subfield, in terms of both topic and research methodology diversity. These findings suggest a considerable distance between both fields, which might hold detrimental consequences in the long run, if no corrective actions are taken.  Originality\/value  This is the first in-depth investigation of the distance between the AIS research field and its parent field of accounting. This study helped develop an AIS classification scheme, which can be used in other research endeavors. This study creates awareness of the divergence between the general accounting research field and the AIS subfield. Given the latter's relevance to the accounting profession, isolation or deterioration of the AIS research must be avoided. Some actionable suggestions are provided in the paper.","Date":"2022-12-09","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2023-04-18 07:08:10","Pages":"61-85","NumPages":null,"Issue":"9","Volume":"36","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":"AAAJ","ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\8C6HHLPM\\Jans et al. - 2022 - Digitalization in accounting\u2013Warmly embraced or co.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Digitization; Accounting","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"BB2YE7CW","ItemType":"report","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"Handler, Jasmine; Preslmayr, Andreas","Title":"Auditing with Process MIning","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"https:\/\/files.fluxicon.com\/Articles\/Auditing-with-Process-Mining.pdf","AbstractNote":null,"Date":"2023","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":null,"Pages":"22","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":"Vienna","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\ADHZYSXQ\\Auditing-with-Process-Mining.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Vendors (Product, Service or Solution); Auditing","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"D6YXI295","ItemType":"report","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"van der Aalst, Wil M.

These systems generate an abundance of events, which can be analyzed to diagnose and improve business processes. However, the events are distributed over different data sources, as service-oriented systems are often implemented asWeb services involving different departments in an organization. They need to be consolidated in a process view since it makes no sense to analyze individual events. Existing approaches depend on an explicit case notion to correlate events. They work well on data from process-aware systems (e.g., BPM\/WFM systems) which record events explicitly and each event is attached with a case id (a global identifier) to indicate its related process instance. However, most serviceoriented systems (e.g., ERP and CRM) produce object-centric data (e.g., database tables), which record events implicitly (e.g., through redo logs) and separately without a common case id. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to correlate events by the data perspective (e.g., by a so-called \"object path\"). Besides, we define the concepts of correlation patterns and evaluation metrics, which enable users to evaluate and select the best way to correlate events based on their needs.

One of the challenges is to manage the component coupling, because highly-coupled components are difficult to distribute, maintain and adapt. Existing techniques that derive a component for each object that changes state in a given process do not consider component interdependencies and run the risk of producing components that are highly coupled. To make coupling explicit and manageable during component identification, we propose an approach for computing the expected coupling of an object-centric implementation for a given process model prior to actually deriving this implementation.

These event data can be analyzed through process mining techniques. For traditional process mining techniques, one has to associate each event with exactly one object, e.g., the company\u2019s customer. Events related to one object form an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run through a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a process model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models. However, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP systems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional sequential case concept falls short of these so-called object-centric event data since these data exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into the traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates the data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case concept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of different process mining tasks on object-centric event data. In this paper, we introduce the case concept for object-centric process mining: process executions. These are graph-based generalizations of cases as considered in traditional process mining. Furthermore, we provide techniques to extract process executions. Based on these executions, we determine equivalent process behavior with respect to an attribute using graph isomorphism. Equivalent process executions with respect to the event\u2019s activity are objectcentric variants, i.e., a generalization of variants in traditional process mining. We provide a visualization technique for objectcentric variants. The contribution\u2019s scalability and efficiency are extensively evaluated. Furthermore, we provide a case study showing the most frequent object-centric variants of a reallife event log. Our contributions might be used as a basis to adapt traditional process mining techniques by researchers and to generate initial control-flow insights into object-centric event logs by practitioners.

Including many case notions can result in a very complex model. To cope with such complexity, this paper introduces a new approach to cluster similar case notions based on Markov Directly-Follow Multigraph, which is an extended version of the wellknown Directly-Follow Graph supported by many industrial and academic process mining tools. This graph is used to calculate a similarity matrix for discovering clusters of similar case notions based on a threshold. A threshold tuning algorithm is also defined to identify sets of different clusters that can be discovered based on different levels of similarity. Thus, the cluster discovery will not rely merely on analysts\u2019 assumptions. The approach is implemented and released as a part of a python library, called processmining, and it is evaluated through a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) object-centric event log file. The discovered clusters are evaluated by discovering Directly Follow-Multigraph by flattening the log based on the clusters. The similarity between identified clusters is also evaluated by calculating the similarity between the behavior of the process models discovered for each case notion using inductive miner based on footprints conformance checking.

However, a single case notion is often not a realistic assumption in practice. Multiple case notions might interact and influence each other in a process. Object-centric process mining introduces the techniques and concepts to handle multiple case notions. So far, such event logs have been standardized and novel process model discovery techniques were proposed. However, notions for evaluating the quality of a model are missing. These are necessary to enable future research on improving object-centric discovery and providing an objective evaluation of model quality. In this paper, we introduce a notion for the precision and fitness of an object-centric Petri net with respect to an object-centric event log. We give a formal definition and accompany this with an example. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to calculate these quality measures. We discuss our precision and fitness notion based on an event log with different models. Our precision and fitness notions are an appropriate way to generalize quality measures to the object-centric setting since we are able to consider multiple case notions, their dependencies and their interactions.

Common process mining techniques consider the process as a whole. However, in real-life business processes, different behaviors exist that make the overall process too complex to interpret. Process comparison is a branch of process mining that isolates different behaviors of the process from each other by using process cubes. Process cubes organize event data using different dimensions. Each cell contains a set of events that can be used as an input to apply process mining techniques. Existing work on process cubes assume single case notions. However, in real processes, several case notions (e.g., order, item, package, etc.) are intertwined. Object-centric process mining is a new branch of process mining addressing multiple case notions in a process. To make a bridge between object-centric process mining and process comparison, we propose a process cube framework, which supports process cube operations such as slice and dice on object-centric event logs. To facilitate the comparison, the framework is integrated with several object-centric process discovery approaches.

For example, when a customer phones her insurance company for information about her insurance claim, she can be given an estimate for the remaining processing time. In order to do this, we provide a configurable approach to construct a process model, augment this model with time information learned from earlier instances, and use this to predict e.g., the completion time. To provide meaningful time predictions we use a configurable set of abstractions that allow for a good balance between \u201coverfitting\u201d and \u201cunderfitting\u201d. The approach has been implemented in ProM and through several experiments using real-life event logs we demonstrate its applicability.

The purpose of this paper is to explore an alternative dimension to process mining in which the objective is to extract process constraints (or business rules) as opposed to business process models. It also focusses on an alternative data set \u2013 process models as opposed to process instances (i.e. event logs).              Design\/methodology\/approach The authors present a new method of knowledge discovery to find business activity sequential patterns embedded in process model repositories. The extracted sequential patterns are considered as business rules.               Findings The authors find significant knowledge hidden in business processes model repositories. The hidden knowledge is considered as business rules. The business rules extracted from process models are significant and valid sequential correlations among business activities belonging to a particular organization. Such business rules represent business constraints that have been encoded in business process models. Experimental results have indicated the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach in extracting business rules from repositories of business process models.              Social implications This research will assist organizations to extract business rules from their existing business process models. The discovered business rules are very important for any organization, where rules can be used to help organizations better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.              Originality\/value There has very been little work in mining business process models as opposed to an increasing number of very large collections of business process models. This work has filled this gap with the focus on extracting business rules.

These logs provide additional data about the activities and behaviour of users. Educational process mining techniques can use these data to unveil useful information to help instructors, educators and administrators accurately monitor, analyze and improve the online learning patterns of students. This research work presents a framework that uses process mining approach to analyse event log data generated within educational information systems, such as LMSs. In this framework, digital twin concept is employed to present a virtual representation of the students\u2019 activities on the LMS. This framework also used inductive and fuzzy miner algorithms to produce a process model which was represented using virtual model of student\u2019s learning patterns. This model was then evaluated for conformance with the activities observed in the log. The analysis conducted during this study showed the disparity between the behaviours of students that passed a particular course and students that failed the course. Findings also showed that the using the inductive and the fuzzy miner algorithms produced better fitness levels for the process model when compared with other previously used algorithms such as the heuristic miner and alpha miner algorithms. This paper concluded by recommending that the development of educational process mining specific tools can help domain experts better understand students\u2019 learning patterns.

This paper uses spreadsheets as a metaphor to introduce process mining as an essential tool for data scientists and business analysts. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that process mining can do with events what spreadsheets can do with numbers.                        Design\/methodology\/approach The paper discusses the main concepts in both spreadsheets and process mining. Using a concrete data set as a running example, the different types of process mining are explained. Where spreadsheets work with numbers, process mining starts from event data with the aim to analyze processes.              Findings Differences and commonalities between spreadsheets and process mining are described. Unlike process mining tools like ProM, spreadsheets programs cannot be used to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, animate event data, and provide operational process support. Pointers to existing process mining tools and their functionality are given.              Practical implications Event logs and operational processes can be found everywhere and process mining techniques are not limited to specific application domains. Comparable to spreadsheet software widely used in finance, production, sales, education, and sports, process mining software can be used in a broad range of organizations.              Originality\/value The paper provides an original view on process mining by relating it to the spreadsheets. The value of spreadsheet-like technology tailored toward the analysis of behavior rather than numbers is illustrated by the over 20 commercial process mining tools available today and the growing adoption in a variety of application domains.

The object is to figure out the potential benefits of digital twin utilization. Methodologically, a conceptual and analytical approach are applied in using statistical data, surveys, latest literature and logical conclusions. Thus, the approach is twofold: from the conceptual point of view the different types of digital twins are introduced; from the analytical point of view different applications in different stages of the PMP will be subject to investigation. So, this paper can be categorized as conceptual paper based on an extensive literature research. The findings of research revealed that the digital transformation can offer various benefits for the PMP. It can be summarized that in all phases of the PMP potential benefits can be identified. The most important is saving time and money, avoiding waste of physical resources and simultaneously raising quality, reliability and competitive advantage. Regarding the originality value it can be stated that this is the first comprehensive examination of the entire PMP with regard to digital transformation in order to identify sources of potential benefits.

Due to the complex and changeable working conditions of coal mine, the key to promote the intelligent construction of coal mine is to ensure the completely controllable, highly safe, and low-cost production process. This chapter adopts digital twin (DT) technology to build coal mine production control model (CMPCM). Firstly, an intelligent interaction mode based on human-cyber-physical system is proposed. Secondly, the key technologies, including intelligent sensing, position and attitude control, running condition identification and abnormal diagnosis, prognostics and health management for key CMEs, and adaptive control for intelligent mining are analyzed. Finally, a typical application case of CMPCM driven by DT is introduced, and its operation process is shown. The DT-driven CMPCM proposed in this chapter provides a new idea for the intelligent construction of underground coal mine.

These challenges have been traditionally analyzed using transport network optimization and simulation techniques. Nevertheless, it is possible to think of process mining as a complementary approach allowing, among other things, to discover behavioral transportation models, obtain execution measures and detect bottlenecks. The objective of this article is to analyze how suitable PM is for the analysis of urban mobility problems. We use open data from the Metropolitan Transportation System (STM) of Montevideo, Uruguay, which, among other things, provides the ability to record up-to-date information on its transportation network and trips of its citizens. We apply process mining to process discovery, both from buses and their users, and carry out various analyses linking such data with time information, costs, types of users, and city areas.

Decay replay mining is one of few deep learning-based next event prediction approaches that are built upon process model notations. However, this algorithm does not fully intertwine its neural network with the available process knowledge contained in the process model. This work, which is an extended version of an earlier conference publication, investigates the reachability graphs of underlying Petri net process models for masking the neural network of decay replay mining to ultimately increase the quality of next event predictions. A more comprehensive set of experiments is performed to provide robust statistical evidence of the usefulness of the approach and relativizes earlier made claims and hypotheses. In addition, the decay replay mining approach is applied with the suggested reachability graph-based masking extension to a healthcare use case of sepsis patients facilitating decision-making for healthcare practitioners. The obtained results further underscore the validity of the masking of neural networks using knowledge contained in the reachability graph of a Petri net process model.

On the one hand, production is moving from mass-production to mass-customization and personalization. Reconfigurable-, adaptive- and evolving-factories are necessary to achieve the required flexibility. On the other hand, technology must be integrated with human skills to assist the operators in supervising and maintaining manufacturing plants with growing complexity. In line with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, a Digital Twin Demonstrator is proposed to support the supervision activity of the operator in the context of flexible manufacturing with robotics. The supervision is achieved through a Human-Computer-Machine Interaction (HCMI) enabled with the Digital Twin technology. The suggested demonstrator is implemented and validated using a lab case study where it is demonstrated how the proposed HCMI interaction enables \u2018close-to-real-time\u2019 supervision of the manufacturing system in its self-adaptation to production and environmental changes.

Standard data mining processes, such as CRISP-DM, have gained broad adoption over the past two decades. However, numerous studies demonstrated that organisations often do not apply CRISP-DM and related processes as-is, but rather adapt them to address industry-specific requirements. Accordingly, a number of sector-specific adaptations of standard data mining processes have been proposed. So far, however, no such adaptation has been suggested for the financial services sector. This paper addresses the gap by designing and evaluating a Financial Industry Process for Data Mining (FIN-DM). FIN-DM adapts and extends CRISP-DM to address regulatory compliance, governance, and risk management requirements inherent in the financial sector, and to embed quality assurance as an integral part of the data mining project life-cycle. The framework has been iteratively designed and validated with data mining and IT experts in a financial services organisation.

Therefore, considering the Digital Shadows (DSs) of individual materials\/sub-parts is not sufficient when analyzing the processes. To this end, holistic views on shopfloor-level processes that integrate multiple DSs are needed. In this work, we discuss how material-centric DSs supported by discrete assembly events can be integrated using techniques from process mining. In particular, we propose to utilize DSs that contain additional structural information to overcome the main challenges of concurrency and the presence of many different objects.

The usefulness of such estimations hinges on the accuracy of the underlying simulation model. Data-Driven Simulation (DDS) methods leverage process mining techniques to learn process simulation models from event logs. Empirical studies have shown that, while DDS models adequately capture the observed sequences of activities and their frequencies, they fail to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of real-life processes. In contrast, generative Deep Learning (DL) models are better able to capture such temporal dynamics. The drawback of DL models is that users cannot alter them for what-if analysis due to their black-box nature. This paper presents a hybrid approach to learn process simulation models from event logs wherein a (stochastic) process model is extracted via DDS techniques, and then combined with a DL model to generate timestamped event sequences. An experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hybrid simulation models match the temporal accuracy of pure DL models, while partially retaining the what-if analysis capability of DDS approaches.

These disciplines, however, mostly work with data at a much lower level of abstraction than business data. This paper discusses an approach for process mining on video data. As a use case, we applied our approach on video surveillance data of pigpens. Although, our process analytics pipeline from raw video data to a discovered process model has not yet been fully implemented, we are convinced that our approach is an essential contribution towards a (semi)automatic technique aiming to replace manual work.

User activity may be recorded during the use of an application or website, resulting in a type of user interaction data often called click data. An obstacle to the analysis of click data using process mining is the lack of a case identifier in the data. In this paper, we show a case and user study for event-case correlation on click data, in the context of user interaction events from a mobility sharing company. To reconstruct the case notion of the process, we apply a novel method to aggregate user interaction data in separate user sessions-interpreted as cases-based on neural networks. To validate our findings, we qualitatively discuss the impact of process mining analyses on the resulting well-formed event log through interviews with process experts.

Autonomous driving and Autonomous Process Execution Management (APEM) have in common that the goals are pretty straightforward and that each year progress is made, but fully autonomous driving and fully autonomous process execution are more a dream than a reality. For cars, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) identified six levels (0-5), ranging from no driving automation (SAE, Level 0) to full driving automation (SAE, Level 5).

The incident and problem management logs contain 7554\/2306 cases and 65533\/9011 events respectively. To create relevant datasets for answering the given questions, we preprocess the logs with the help of PL-SQL and Java. The datasets are analyzed using ProM and Disco\u2019s stateof-the-art process mining capabilities, SQL, and traditional spreadsheet-based techniques. We provide evidence-based answers to the questions and demonstrate the potential benefits of process mining-based understanding and analysis of business processes.

To achieve sustained benefits from these techniques, organizations have adopted standardized processes for managing data mining projects, most notably CRISP-DM. Research has shown that these standardized processes are often not used as prescribed, but instead, they are extended and adapted to address a variety of requirements. To improve the understanding of how standardized data mining processes are extended and adapted in practice, this paper reports on a case study in a financial services organization, aimed at identifying perceived gaps in the CRISP-DM process and characterizing how CRISP-DM is adapted to address these gaps. The case study was conducted based on documentation from a portfolio of data mining projects, complemented by semi-structured interviews with project participants. The results reveal 18 perceived gaps in CRISP-DM alongside their perceived impact and mechanisms employed to address these gaps. The identified gaps are grouped into six categories. Next, they were triangulated and augmented with the gaps discovered in the other studies. Then, the requirements for adapting CRISP-DM to address the gaps were derived, and the directions for the potential adaptations were outlined.

Process mining aims to dis cover, monitor, and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs in a structural way. This thesis discusses how companies could get detailed insights into their process by meas uring quality (i.e., conformance) and performance not only on the entire process model or single activities, but also on parts of the model, i.e., on different levels of granularity. For this purpose process trees are used, in which the process is represented by a tree. The resulting hierarchy can be exploited to perform quality and performance analyses on different levels of granularity. Currently, no techniques are present to measure quality and performance and visualize these measurements on process trees. Therefore, we define quality and performance metrics for process trees, and visualize the results in both static and dynamic ways. The static visualizations project the results on elements of the process tree, the dynamic visualizations show an animation of the steps executed in the process on the process tree. In order to extract information from an event log we need to construct an alignment between a process model discovered from an event log and the event log itself. Then, we can measure the quality of the model and the performance of the process. Subsequently, we can visualize these measurements by projecting them on elements of the process model. All work presented in this thesis has been implemented in the Process Mining (ProM) framework.

Generalization is one of the quality criteria applied to process models to quantify how well the model describes future executions of the system. Generalization is also perhaps the least understood of those criteria, with that lack primarily a consequence of it measuring properties over the entire future behavior of the system when the only available sample of behavior is that provided by the log. In this paper, we apply a bootstrap approach from computational statistics, allowing us to define an estimator of the model's generalization based on the log it was discovered from. We show that standard process mining assumptions lead to a consistent estimator that makes fewer errors as the quality of the log increases. Experiments confirm the ability of the approach to support industry-scale data-driven systems engineering.

Petri in his seminal Ph.D. thesis in 1964. Petri nets has remained a central model for concurrent systems for 40 years, and they are often used a sa yardstick for other models of concurrency. As a matter of fact, many other models have been developed since then, and this research area is ?ourishing today. The goal of the 4th Advanced Course on Petri Nets held in Eichsta tt, Germany in September 2003 was to present applications and the theory of Petri Nets in the context of a whole range of other models. We believe that in this way the participants of the course received a broad and in-depth picture of research in concurrent and distributed systems. It is also the goal of this volume to convey this picture. The volume is based on lectures given at the Advanced Course, but in order to provide a balanced p- sentation of the ?eld, some of the lectures are not included, and some material not presented in Eichst att is covered here. In particular, a series of introductory lectures was not included in this volume, as the material they covered is well - tablished by now, and well presented elsewhere (e.g., in W. Reisig andG. Rozberg, eds., Lectures on Petri Nets, LNCS 1491, 1492, Springer-Verlag, 1997 these two volumes are based on the 3rd Advanced Course on Petri Nets).

While Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collecting more and more data on the physical context in which business processes are executed, the IoT and process mining fields are still considerably disintegrated. Important concepts, such as event or context, are not understood in the same way, which causes confusion and hinders cooperation between the two domains. Based on IoT ontologies and business process context models, this paper proposes a model to bridge the conceptualisation gap between the IoT and the process mining fields. The model defines the necessary concepts and relationships to build process mining techniques that take the physical context into account. As a first validation, the model is used to describe a lifelike process example, showing how IoT data and process events are related. Using this conceptualisation, both practitioners and researchers from the IoT and the process mining communities can reason about the use of IoT data in process mining and find support for data understanding, event abstraction and IoT and process data integration.

For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.

A Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) exploits these infrastructures to provide an accurate digital representation of the organization. Beyond the usual representation of devices, machines and physical assets supplied by Digital Twins, a DTO also include processes, services, people, roles, and all other relevant elements for the operation of organizations. Therefore, DTO can play a key role in realizing and analyzing aspects of organizations, assisting managers on the knowledge of the organization status, and foreseeing possible effects of potential changes in the organization. However, due to the dynamic, open, and ever-changing environment of organizations, an established DTO will soon degrade or even lose all its utility. Therefore, a DTO needs to evolve to recover its utility when the organization changes. The development of flexible, resilient, and easy to evolve DTO has not been well-addressed yet. Most of the existing proposals are context-dependent, system-specific, or focus on providing solutions in high-level abstraction. This work leverages Enterprise Architecture to propose an architectural pattern to serve as a blueprint toward the development of resilient DTO.

The research problem is to understand the concepts of digital twin, its place and role in digital economy, digitalization, and industry 4.0. The purpose of this study is to clarify the content of these concepts, with the formation of a comprehensive management approach to their practical implementation in industrial supply chains, with the harmonious participation of various specialists related to the problems of modern production. Technologies, methods, technical solutions, and best practices should become significant in the processes of modern supply chains. The article provides an overview of theoretical research and current trends in the development of the concept of \"digital economy\", analyzes the technical and economic grounds for such changes, and defines the directions for further development of such research. The difference between engineering and economic approaches to the problem of production management is shown. The authors substantiate the urgency of the translation of models of supply chains in a digital format. The goal of the proposed digital model is to find the optimal criterion of economic efficiency and get recommendations for building a logistics cycle for the selected planning horizon on the example of the Huawei enterprise. In conclusion, the article considers the concept of \"digital twin\" of supply chain processes, which is correlated with simulation methods. The simulation and digital twin are considered as the optimization procedures for optimal control, important and promising technical procedures of industry 4.0. Based on the study of the literature, the characteristics and properties of \"digital twins\", the importance for production management and other processes of supply chains are highlighted.

Their success has raised the promise and the \u201cgrand challenge\u201d of digital twins of organizations. To the extent that organizations include networks of interdependent processes, human agency and conflict, and learning, we argue that building valid, reliable digital twins of organizations involves substantial challenges that might require new methods and new science as compared to current models of business processes. For instance, we need a richer, more complete vocabulary to describe interdependence and regulatory mechanisms that managers can use to design and intervene in networks of interdependent processes. Models from biological sciences might provide fruitful inspiration, given that regulatory networks play important roles in biological systems. If we are serious about digital twins of organizations, we need to push the boundaries of process methods and process science.

However, the lack of engineering best practices for developing and operating a Digital Twin of the Organization makes it difficult for enterprises to fully benefit from it. Many companies are currently investigating the potential use of it, but available solutions are often context-dependent or system-specific, and challenging to adapt, extend, and reuse. Therefore, digitalization is perceived as a slow, resource-demanding, and extremely expensive process whose outcome is uncertain. To this extent, enterprises seek solutions allowing them to gently introduce a Digital Twin of the Organization into their organization and to evolve it according to the changing needs and situations. This paper reports a first attempt on architecting a Digital Twin of an Organization, and discusses some architectural concerns to be addressed in order to facilitate its development and evolution.

Manufacturing companies need to adapt to ever-changing environments by simultaneously reforming and regenerating their product, process, and system models as well as goals and strategies to stay competitive. However, the ever-increasing complexity and ever-shortening lifecycles of product, process and system domains challenge manufacturing organization\u2019s conventional approaches to analysing and formalizing models and processes as well as management, maintenance and simulation of product and system life cycles. The digital twin-based virtual factory (VF) concept, as an integrated simulation model of a factory including its subsystems, is promising for supporting manufacturing organizations in adapting to dynamic and complex environments. In this paper, we present the demonstration and evaluation of previously introduced digital twin-based VF concept to support modelling, simulation and evaluation of complex manufacturing systems while employing multi-user collaborative virtual reality (VR) learning\/training scenarios. The concept is demonstrated and evaluated using two different wind turbine manufacturing cases, including a wind blade manufacturing plant and a nacelle assembly line. Thirteen industry experts who have diverse backgrounds and expertise were interviewed after their participation in a demonstration. We present the experts\u2019 discussions and arguments to evaluate the DT-based VF concept based on four dimensions, namely, dynamic, open, cognitive, and holistic systems. The semi-structured conversational interview results show that the DT-based VF stands out by having the potential to support concurrent engineering by virtual collaboration. Moreover, DT-based VF is promising for decreasing physical builds and saving time by virtual prototyping (VP).

By providing a live copy of physical systems, digital twins bring to the table numerous advantages such as accelerated business processes, enhanced productivity, and faster innovation with reduced costs. For these numerous advantages digital twin is an ideal solution for several problems in domains such as Industry 4.0, education, healthcare and smart cities. However, to make sure the digital twin contributes effectively to these domains by representing a synchronized real-time copy of the physical system, the network connecting the physical and digital twins should fulfill a set of requirements such as low latency of real-time communication, data security and quality. This paper provides an overview on the technology of digital twin and its application domains with a detailed discussion on its networking requirements and proposed enabling technologies to fulfill them.

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.

Each of these approaches reflects specific demands in the whole process-data integration spectrum. One particularly important point is the capability of these approaches to flexibly accommodate processes with multiple case objects that need to co-evolve. In this work, we introduce and study an extension of coloured Petri nets, called catalogue and object-aware nets (COA-nets), providing two key features to capture this type of processes. On the one hand, net transitions are equipped with guards that simultaneously inspect the content of tokens and query facts stored in a read-only, persistent database. On the other hand, such transitions can inject data into tokens by extracting relevant values from the database or by generating genuinely fresh ones. We demonstrate that this class of nets can be used for representing various multi-case modelling scenarios involving objects with one-to-many correlations. We then study a parameterised verification problem of COA-nets and show how to systematically encode them into one of the reference frameworks for attacking that kind of problem in the context of infinite-state systems with data. We demonstrate that different fragments of COA-nets can have different expressive power that can affect the decidability of not only the verification problem at hand, but also the standard problem of place nonemptiness checking. Finally, we discuss how COA-nets relate to well-known formalisms in the area of multi-case and data-aware process modelling and analysis.

Among others, they need to understand how these resources act in groups to achieve organizational outcomes. Accurate and timely information is a sine qua non to achieve this understanding. Process mining can be exploited for the purpose of deriving organizational models from event logs that contain resource-related data. But existing process mining techniques are not fully up to this task, as they are not able to cope with the multi-faceted nature of business processes and are not yet able to determine how resource groupings are involved in process execution. In addition, there is no provision for how to evaluate the quality of discovered organizational models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, OrdinoR, capable of supporting discovery of organizational models using event logs, their evaluation, and their analysis. OrdinoR is constructed around a rich notion of organizational model where resource groupings are linked to multiple dimensions of process execution. The framework also provides a set of measures for systematically evaluating such models and analyzing the behavior of resource groups therein. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the framework using a publicly available real-life dataset. These demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.

Artifact-centric processes) are implementations of a paradigm where an instance of one process is not executed in isolation but interacts with other instances of the same or other processes. Interactions take place through bridging events where instances exchange data. Object-centric processes are recently gaining popularity in academia and industry, because their nature is observed in many application scenarios. This poses significant challenges in predictive analytics due to the complex intricacy of the process instances that relate to each other via many-to-many associations. Existing research is unable to directly exploit the benefits of these interactions, thus limiting the prediction quality. This paper proposes an approach to incorporate the information about the object interactions into the predictive models. The approach is assessed on real-life object-centric process event data, using different KPIs. The results are compared with a naive approach that overlooks the object interactions, thus illustrating the benefits of their use on the prediction quality.

The vast majority of contemporary discovery algorithms aims at the identification of control-flow constructs. The increase in data richness, however, enables discovery that incorporates the context of process execution beyond the control-flow perspective. A \u201ccontrol-flow first\u201d approach, where context data serves for refinement and annotation, is limited and fails to detect fundamental changes in the control-flow that depend on context data. In this work, we thus propose a novel approach for combining the control-flow and data perspectives under a single roof by extending inductive process discovery. Our approach provides criteria under which context data, handled through unsupervised learning, take priority over control-flow in guiding process discovery. The resulting model is a process tree, in which some operators carry data semantics instead of control-flow semantics. We show that the proposed approach produces trees that are context consistent, deterministic, complete, and can be explainable without a major quality reduction. We evaluate the approach using synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that the resulting models are superior to state-of-the-art discovery methods in terms of measures based on multi-perspective alignments.

Existing prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of interventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific interventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan origination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative loan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This intervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus, it is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper proposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers interventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The proposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are likely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to estimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These outputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost function. A preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed approach produces a higher net gain than a purely predictive (non-causal) baseline.

To this end, process mining offers methods and techniques for systematically analyzing event data. These data are generated during the execution of processes and stored in organizations' information systems. Process discovery, a key discipline in process mining, comprises techniques used to (automatically) learn a process model from event data. However, existing algorithms typically provide low-quality models from real-life event data due to data-quality issues and incompletely captured process behavior. Automated filtering of event data is valuable in obtaining better process models. At the same time, it is often too rigorous, i.e., it also removes valuable and correct data. In many cases, prior knowledge about the process under investigation can be additionally used for process discovery besides event data. Therefore, a new family of discovery algorithms has been developed that utilizes domain knowledge about the process in addition to event data. To organize this research, we present a literature review of process discovery approaches exploiting domain knowledge. We define a taxonomy that systematically classifies and compares existing approaches. Finally, we identify remaining challenges for future work.

These techniques are leveraged in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, where it focuses mainly on the analysis of diagnostic, treatment, and organisational processes. Despite the huge amount of data generated in hospitals by staff and machinery involved in healthcare processes, there is no evidence of a systematic uptake of process mining beyond targeted case studies in a research context. When developing and using process mining in healthcare, distinguishing characteristics of healthcare processes such as their variability and patient-centred focus require targeted attention.

The IoT data can be indeed used to discover human habits and interaction patterns, useful to both improve human experience and further automatize the system. Process Mining can be leveraged on for this purpose, but a gap needs to be bridged between IoT-device event data and logs by aggregating events to take to the right granularity for Process Mining. This papers reports on the experience on real-life data to discover the human habits in a smart house. In particular, the benefits are reported on how to aggregate event data to the right granularity to further apply process-mining discovery techniques. The results illustrate that, when applied on the case study, the proposed technique is able to discover human-habit models that are more readable and accurate, thus providing actionable insights for a subsequent optimization of the human experience with the IoT system.

Utility of digital twins in engineering cannot be overestimated. In fact, automotive, industrial and power grid engineering already heavily rely on model-based design practices.

Thus, the construction demand for disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (DPMI) systems is increasing. Many studies have applied intelligence technologies to solve key aspects of infrastructure, such as design, construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery; however, systematic construction is still lacking. Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which has great potential to solve the above challenges. This paper initially puts forward a scientific concept, in which DT drives the construction of intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (IDPMI) systematically. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and IDPMI is performed, where the development of DT is summarized and a DT-based life cycle of infrastructures is defined. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in disaster management are key reviewed and their relative merits are illustrated. Furthermore, the development and technical feasibility of DT-driven IDPMI are illustrated by reviewing the relevant practice of DT in infrastructure. In conclusion, a scientific framework of DT-IDPMI is programmed, which not only provides some guidance for the deep integration between DT and IDPMI but also identifies the challenges that inspire the professional community to advance these techniques to address them in future research.

Hence, supply chain managers need to create and unlock the value of the smart supply chain. A smart supply chain requires connectivity, visibility, and agility, and it needs be integrated and intelligent. The digital twin (DT) concept satisfies these requirements. Therefore, we propose creating a DT-driven supply chain (DTSC) as an innovative and integrated solution for the smart supply chain. We provide background information to explain the DT concept and to demonstrate the method for building a DTSC by using the DT concept. We discuss three research opportunities in building a DTSC, including supply chain modeling, real-time supply chain optimization, and data usage in supply chain collaboration. Finally, we highlight a motivating case from JD.COM, China\u2019s largest retailer by revenue, in applying the DTSC platform to address supply chain network reconfiguration challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the research of DT for product life cycle management is still in the theoretical stage, the application framework and application methods are not clear, and the lack of referable application cases is also a problem. In this paper, the related research and application of DT technology are systematically studied. Then the concept and characteristics of DT are interpreted from both broad sense and narrow sense. On this basis, an application framework of DT for product lifecycle management is proposed. In physical space, the total-elements information perception technology of production is discussed in detail. In the information processing layer, three main function modules, including data storage, data processing and data mapping, are constructed. In virtual space, this paper describes the implementation process of full parametric virtual modeling and the construction idea for DT application subsystems. At last, a DT case of a welding production line is built and studied. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are detail described to provide reference for enterprises.

Even though recent research has proposed various methods and performed an increasing number of case studies, there are still issues of communication processes to be addressed. This paper presents a theoretical framework for digital systems integration of virtual models and smart technologies. Based on the comprehensive analysis of existing technologies for indoor localization, a new workflow is defined and designed, and it is utilized in a practical case study to test the model performance. In the new workflow, a facility management supporting platform is proposed and characterized, featuring indoor positioning systems to allow end users to send geo-referenced reports to central virtual models. In addition, system requirements, information technology (IT) architecture and application procedures are presented. Results show that the integration of end users in the maintenance processes through smart and easy tools can overcome the existing limits of barcode systems and building management systems for failure localization. The proposed framework offers several advantages. First, it allows the identification of every element of an asset including wide physical building elements (walls, floors, etc.) without requiring a prior mapping. Second, the entire cycle of maintenance activities is managed through a unique integrated system including the territorial dimension. Third, data are collected in a standard structure for future uses.

It has been used for various use cases within the healthcare domain with the ambition to instigate evidence-based process improvement. Over the past years, the research interest in process mining in healthcare has been increasing. This paper presents the results of an extensive systematic literature review on process mining in healthcare in which 263 papers have been reviewed. Besides providing the most recent overview of literature and the extensive number of reviewed papers, we complement existing reviews by considering three novel review dimensions: (i) the process mining project stages, (ii) the involvement of domain expertise, and (iii) the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) considered during the process mining analysis. Orthogonal to these three novel dimensions, we also highlight the evolution of the research domain by considering time trends within the review dimensions. The review generates new perspectives on process mining in healthcare as a research domain. For instance, process redesign is rarely part of a process mining project, domain experts are mostly asked for validating insights, and less than half of the published papers considers one or more specific KPIs to direct their analysis.

Process Mining can be exploited to distill models from real process executions recorded in event logs, but existing techniques show some limitations when applied in complex domains, where human actors have high degree of freedom in the execution of activities thus generating highly variable processes instances. This paper contributes to the research on Process Mining in highly variable domains, focusing on the generation of process instance models (in the form of instance graphs) from simple event logs. The novelty of the approach is in the exploitation of filtering Process Discovery (PD) techniques coupled with repairing, which allows obtaining accurate models for any instance variant, even for rare ones. It is argued that this provides the analyst with a more complete and faithful knowledge of a highly variable process, where no process execution can be really targeted as \u201cwrong\u201d and hence overlooked. The approach can also find application in more structured domains, in order to obtain accurate models of exceptional behaviors. The quality of generated models will be assessed by suitable metrics and measured in empirical experiments enlightening the advantage of the approach.

To this end, Business Process Management has developed a rich array of methods that can be used to analyze digital trace data. Routine Dynamics has put less emphasis on the analysis of digital trace data, but it has advanced a methodological approach that promotes discovery, i.e., the process that actors perform and experience as they develop novel insights. This paper argues that the analysis of digital trace data can promote the process of discovery.

Even seemingly simple processes like Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) and Order-to-Cash (O2C) are often amazingly complex, and traditional hand-made process models fail to capture the true fabric of such processes. Many processes are inherently concurrent and involve interaction between different objects (customers, suppliers, orders, items, shipments, payments, machines, workers, etc.). Process mining uses event data to construct process models that can be used to diagnose performance and compliance problems. If such models reflect reality well, they can be used for forward-looking forms of process mining, including predictive analytics, evidence-based automation, and what-if simulation. The ultimate goal is to create a \u201cdigital twin of an organization\u201d that can be used to explore different improvement actions. This paper provides a high-level overview of the different process mining tasks followed by a more detailed discussion on concurrency and object-centricity in process mining.

In an experiment, we let novice modelers perform modeling tasks individually and in pairs. Contrary to pair programming findings, we could not statistically support that pair modeling improves the process model\u2019s quality.

However, often its application is hindered by the considerable preparation effort that needs to be conducted by humans. One of the key tasks required in this context is obtaining the input artifact for process mining techniques: the event log. The data that is required for building such an event log typically needs to be collected from several databases and then transformed into a suitable format. While it has become clear to both academics and practitioners that the amount of human work is substantial, there is no deep understanding of the exact activities humans need to perform. Therefore, we use this paper to develop a precise understanding of how humans are involved in event log extraction. Based on a structured literature review and qualitative data coding, we derive a taxonomy of human tasks in event log extraction. This taxonomy can serve as input for both future automation efforts, as well as for process mining methodologies.

Uncertain events, process traces and logs contain attributes that are characterized by quantified imprecisions, e.g., a set of possible attribute values.

Such predictions are of significant interest to the process stakeholders. However, state-of-the-art methods for predictive monitoring require the training of complex machine learning models, which is often inefficient. This paper proposes an instance selection procedure that allows sampling training process instances for prediction models. We show that our sampling method allows for a significant increase of training speed for next activity prediction methods while maintaining reliable levels of prediction accuracy.

These are made available in the form of event logs. Process mining techniques enable the process-centric analysis of data, including automatically discovering process models and checking if event data conform to a given model. In this paper, we analyze the previously unexplored setting of uncertain event logs. In such event logs uncertainty is recorded explicitly, i.e., the time, activity and case of an event may be unclear or imprecise. In this work, we define a taxonomy of uncertain event logs and models, and we examine the challenges that uncertainty poses on process discovery and conformance checking. Finally, we show how upper and lower bounds for conformance can be obtained by aligning an uncertain trace onto a regular process model.

Common process mining techniques consider the process as a whole. However, in real-life business processes, different behaviors exist that make the overall process too complex to interpret. Process comparison is a branch of process mining that isolates different behaviors of the process from each other by using process cubes. Process cubes organize event data using different dimensions. Each cell contains a set of events that can be used as an input to apply process mining techniques. Existing work on process cubes assume single case notions. However, in real processes, several case notions (e.g., order, item, package, etc.) are intertwined. Object-centric process mining is a new branch of process mining addressing multiple case notions in a process. To make a bridge between object-centric process mining and process comparison, we propose a process cube framework, which supports process cube operations such as slice and dice on object-centric event logs. To facilitate the comparison, the framework is integrated with several object-centric process discovery approaches.

On the one hand, financial institutions need to quickly adapt to new compliance regulations that require adapting their internal processes. On the other hand, Fintechs are changing the traditional banking rules by introducing innovative financial processes. Therefore, financial institutions need to be able to improve their operational inefficiencies, and represents a business case for the application of process mining techniques. In this final degree project a real case is faced through different process and data mining techniques. The data used was provided in the BPIC 2017. This challenge proposes a real use case where a Dutch financial institution provides event logs of the loan approval process, with 1.202.267 events pertaining to 31.509 applications. For the approach, we leverage the Disco process mining tool with Python-based data analysis and visualization tools such as Pandas in order to combine different granularity inspection techniques to provide answers to the given questions. In particular, we focus on the main requests from the BPIC 2017 challenge, which are: throughput times per part of the process, influence on the frequency of incompleteness to the final outcome and the frequency of customers asking for more than one offer. Our approach has consisted in identifying the process phases and analyzing each question by phase and then globally. Finally, we discuss concluding remarks and future work.

And not doing it can affect its resources, its environment, or its continuity. One of the techniques most used by companies to design and evaluate their processes is business process simulation. This technique allows creating hypothetical scenarios and assessing the consequences of their implementation in a virtual environment without taking the risks of failure in real life. Modifying the process components in the simulator allows the analysts to make assumptions such as \"if you remove this, this could happen, or if you add this, this could happen.\" This ability is very convenient to support the decision-making process concerning potential changes. The problem with this method is that creating and fitting a simulation model is a complex task that requires time and specialized technical knowledge. In addition, analysts usually create simulation models through interviews, observations, and sampling. All these techniques are highly prone to biases, which means that the precision of these manually created models is relatively inaccurate. All this makes disappointing the adoption of business process simulation, making it difficult for companies to use this technique. This thesis proposes new techniques for creating business process simulation models that use data extracted from enterprise information systems in conjunction with neural networks and process mining algorithms. This thesis aims to create a more precise automatic simulation technique that requires less human intervention solving the drawbacks of the current process simulation approach. We consolidate the techniques proposed in this thesis in two open-source tools. The first tool, called Simod, can fully automatically discover and fine-tune simulation models through process mining techniques. However, the proposed method often falls short when it comes to predicting the timing of each activity. In response, the second tool called DeepSimulator combines discovery techniques based on process mining with generative models based on deep learning. The evaluation results of this hybrid approach lead to simulations that more closely reflect the observed dynamics of the process than methods based purely on process mining or deep learning.

However, the analysis of the engineering-to-order (ETO) production system is limited. Stage-based process performance mining has been around to monitor and analyze the process in the predefined stages level. In the ETO production system, it requires more flexibility to analyze the stages. Meanwhile, previous work assumed that the cases should follow the sequence of all predefined stages which is not the case in the ETO production system. This study extends the stage-based process performance analysis by relaxing the definition of the stages, that is referred as a relax-stage-based process performance mining. It emphasizes the flexibility to analyze the process through three different stages: mandatory, necessary, and optional. The concept has been tested in a log data of shipbuilding company. The proof-of-concept of relax-stage-based process performance mining is shown by displaying the time-domain and frequency-domain process performance analysis, including the constructed process model.

In the field of business process, heuristic miner has been used to handle data noise in the event logs. This study aims to propose a method to build a transition matrix using the causal matrix based on the dependency measure in heuristic miner. The dependency measure resulted from heuristic miner is fed into a collaborative filtering approach, that is matrix factorization, to build a model. In the end, we compare the performance of the causal matrix with a traditional frequency-based approach to see the effect of the proposed method to remove the noise. The result showed that a transition matrix with a causal matrix from heuristic miner can produce a better performance than the transition matrix without the dependency measure with a causal matrix.

Using an RPA tool, a user can develop a software bot that can execute a sequence of interactive steps with one or more software applications. For example, we can use an RPA tool to develop a software bot that opens a spreadsheet, then opens a Web form, and then copy-pastes data from one of the cells in the spreadsheet into one of the fields in the Web form. While RPA tools allow users to automate many types of tasks, they do not help users to determine which tasks are candidates for automation. The current practice for identifying routines that are suitable for RPA automation is by means of interviews and observation of workers conducting their daily work. This manual approach is time-consuming and is not cost-efficient, especially in organizations that have a very large number of routines. In this thesis, we propose a set of techniques, which we call Robotic Process Mining (RPM) techniques, to discover automatable routines from recordings of interactions between one or more workers and one or more software applications. The goal of RPM techniques is to help business analysts to draw a systematic inventory of the tasks that can be automated in an organization. In addition, these techniques can produce scripts (programs) to automate each automatable task. The techniques proposed in this thesis have been consolidated in an open-source tool called Robidium. Robidium starts by recording one or more work sessions of several hours from one or more workers in an organization. Robidium then analyzes these recordings to discover sequences of steps that are frequently repeated (routines). Each routine is analyzed to determine if it can be automated using a software bot. When possible, Robidium produces a software bot capable of performing each routine automatically.

Process mining requires event logs extracted from information systems supporting these processes. The eXtensible Event Stream (XES) format is the current standard which requires a case notion to correlate events. However, it has problems to deal with object-centric data (e.g., database tables) due to the existence of one-to-many and many-to-many relations. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract, transform and store object-centric data, resulting in eXtensible Object-Centric (XOC) event logs. The XOC format does not require a case notion to avoid flattening multi-dimensional data. Besides, based on so-called object models which represent the states of a database, a XOC log can reveal the evolution of the database along with corresponding events. Dealing with object-centric data enables new process mining techniques that are able to capture the real processes much better.

At the same time, they face a jungle of continuously changing regulations, e.g., due to the pandemic and developments such as the BREXIT, which strongly affect cross-organizational collaborations. Think of, for example, supply chains spanning several countries with different and maybe even conflicting COVID19 travelling restrictions. Hence, providing automatic compliance verification in process choreographies is crucial for any cross-organizational business process. A particular challenge concerns the restricted visibility of the partner processes at the presence of global compliance rules (GCR), i.e., rules that span across the process of several partners. This work deals with the question how to verify global compliance if affected tasks are not fully visible. Our idea is to decompose GCRs into so called assertions that can be checked by each affected partner whereby the decomposition is both correct and lossless. The algorithm exploits transitivity properties of the underlying rule specification, and its correctness and complexity are proven, considering advanced aspects such as loops. The algorithm is implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype, including a model checker for verifying compliance. The applicability of the approach is further demonstrated on a real-world manufacturing use case.

A forecasted model is a will-be process model representing a probable future state of the overall process. Such a forecast helps to investigate the consequences of drift and emerging bottlenecks. Our technique builds on a representation of event data as multiple time series, each capturing the evolution of a behavioural aspect of the process model, such that corresponding forecasting techniques can be applied. Our implementation demonstrates the accuracy of our technique on real-world event log data.

In some use cases, particularly those involving customer-facing processes, these event logs may contain private information. Data protection regulations restrict the use of such event logs for analysis purposes. One way of circumventing these restrictions is to anonymize the event log to the extent that no individual can be singled out using the anonymized log. This article addresses the problem of anonymizing an event log in order to guarantee that, upon release of the anonymized log, the probability that an attacker may single out any individual represented in the original log does not increase by more than a threshold. The article proposes a differentially private release mechanism, which samples the cases in the log and adds noise to the timestamps to the extent required to achieve the above privacy guarantee. The article reports on an empirical comparison of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art approaches using 14 real-life event logs in terms of data utility loss and computational efficiency.

Recent technological advances and the explosion of digital data have introduced data-driven methods (DDMs) in rail operations. In this study, DDMs on the TD problem are briefly explored, focusing on relevant studies on delay distribution, delay propagation, and timetable rescheduling. Data-driven TD methods, including statistical methods (SM), graphical models (GM), and machine learning (ML) methods are reviewed. Then, key issues in establishing different data-driven models for the TD problem are addressed. Subsequently, ML methods are considered to be among the most promising DDMs that lead to innovative TD methods, relying on rich data obtained from train operations. This study emphasizes the potentials for designing new alternatives in the three key fields of interest and provides directions for further research on TD. Future research, including the ML-driven TD and intelligent TD, were discussed in this study.

Although the general contributions of Nordsieck to the study of business processes is often acknowledged, there is hardly any reflection on his specific findings on process modeling in any of the works after World War II. This is problematic since research on process modeling often assumes that later works on Petri nets and IDEF in the 1960s defined the starting point of process modeling. In this article, we discuss the contributions of Nordsieck's thesis. We find that the practice of workflow modeling was already richly developed in the 1920s. Even though some present-day concepts were still missing, the thesis still has the potential to inform contemporary research. Most important is the discussion of different categories of diagrams on a spectrum from spatio-temporal to conceptual, which demonstrates the need of re-integrating ideas from information visualization and conceptual modeling, two fields that have been artificially separated and researched by different communities over the last 40 years.

This task aims to predict the behavior of an ongoing process based on the historical data stored in event logs. Since feed-forward neural networks do not consider the order of events for the prediction, they may not be helpful in predictive process monitoring. Recent research shows that using Recurrent Neural Networks such as LSTM and GRU may not be also helpful in predictive process monitoring. Because these networks use only the last hidden state as the context vector, and may lose some of past information, especially in long sequences. In addition, many existing approaches just use the activity name of each event as the representative of that event. In this context, they may ignore other events\u2019 attributes in generating the feature vector. Some works have utilized these attributes simply by concatenating all of them together. While we need to use all event attributes to predict the next activity, it should be noted that not all of them are equally important. In this paper, we use two layers of attention mechanism on top of LSTM: (i) at the attribute level, to determine which attributes have more importance; and (ii) at the event level, to identify important events in predicting the next activity. Experimental evaluation of the real-world event logs showed that the use of hierarchical attention mechanisms in the proposed approach could effectively predict the next activity of an ongoing process.

In particular, extracting event logs from popular ERP systems such as SAP poses major challenges, given the size and the structure of the data. Open-source support for ETL is scarce, while commercial process mining vendors maintain connectors to ERP systems supporting ETL of a limited number of business processes in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we propose an approach to facilitate event data extraction from SAP ERP systems. In the proposed approach, we store event data in the format of object-centric event logs that efficiently describe executions of business processes supported by ERP systems. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have developed a tool implementing it and conducted case studies with a real-life SAP ERP system.

Process outcomes are not only affected by process data, but also by data that is not associated with the process logic through decisions or task input. The rising temperature in a machine, for example, might cause deterioration of part quality. Assessing the impact of context data on the process outcome at runtime is particularly useful to reduce the reaction time to possible errors or deviations. However, as process models contain loops and decisions, grouping and making context data streams interpretable is not always straight-forward, especially under the condition that describing dependencies between context data and process data should be simple and flexible. The contribution of this paper is a classification of context data types, how they are connected to a process model, and how process models can be segmented into stages to group semantically related tasks. The impact of context data on the process outcome is then determined during runtime, i.e., as a process instance is progressing through these segments at runtime, impact calculations using context data can be gradually refined. The approach is prototypically implemented and applied to an artificial logistics and a real-world manufacturing data set.

Several process mining vendors are in the process of implementing conformance checking in their tools to allow the user to check how well a model fits an event log. Current approaches for conformance checking are monolithic and compute exact fitness values but this may take excessive time. Alternatively, one can use a decomposition approach, which runs much faster but does not always compute an exact fitness value. This paper introduces a recomposition approach that takes the best of both: it returns the exact fitness value by using the decomposition approach in an iterative manner. Results show that similar speedups can be obtained as by using the decomposition approach, but now the exact fitness value is guaranteed. Even better, this approach supports a configurable time-bound: \u201cGive me the best fitness estimation you can find within 10 min.\u201d In such a case, the approach returns an interval that contains the exact fitness value. If such an interval is sufficiently narrow, there is no need to spend unnecessary time to compute the exact value.

An assessment is required to check how well a set of discovered rules describes the input data, and to determine to what extent data complies with predefined rules. Particularly in declarative process mining, Support and Confidence are used most often, yet they are reportedly unable to provide a sufficiently rich feedback to users and cause rules representing coincidental behavior to be deemed as representative for the event logs. In addition, these measures are designed to work on a predefined set of rules, thus lacking generality and extensibility. In this paper, we address this research gap by developing a measurement framework for temporal rules based on (LTLp). The framework is suitable for any temporal rules expressed in a reactive form and for custom measures based on the probabilistic interpretation of such rules. We show that our framework can seamlessly adapt well-known measures of the association rule mining field to declarative process mining. Also, we test our software prototype implementing the framework on synthetic and real-world data, and investigate the properties characterizing those measures in the context of process analysis.

Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools do not provide mechanisms to cope with the flexibility requirements inherent to open and dynamic collaboration environments. In particular, existing tools adopt a static role binding approach wherein roles are bound to actors upfront when a process instance is created. Also, these tools do not allow participants to collectively make choices regarding alternative sub-processes or branches in the process model, at runtime. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. Furthermore, the paper introduces a model for consensus-based control-flow flexibility, wherein participants in a process can collectively agree on how to steer the business process within the boundaries defined by control-flow agreement policies.

An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles, control-flow elements, and policy constraints.

For example, machine learning employs a range of algorithms that deliver important insights based on analysis of data resources. Similarly, process mining develops algorithms that use event data induced by real-world processes to support the modeling of \u2013 and hence understanding and long-term improvement of \u2013 those processes. In process mining, the quality of the learned process models is assessed using conformance checking techniques, which measure how well the models represent and generalize the data. This article presents the entropic relevance measure for conformance checking of stochastic process models, which are models that also provide information in regard to the likelihood of observing each sequence of observed events. Accurate stochastic conformance measurement allows identification of models that describe the data better, including the captured sequences of process events and their frequencies, with information about the likelihood of the described processes being an essential step toward simulating and forecasting future processes. Entropic relevance represents a blend between the traditional precision and recall quality criteria in conformance checking, in that it both penalizes observed processes that the model does not describe, and also penalizes processes that are permitted by the model yet were not observed. Entropic relevance can be computed in time linear in the size of the input data; and measures a fundamentally different phenomenon than other existing measures. Our evaluation over industrial datasets confirms the feasibility of using the measure in practice.

The SLR provides insights into challenges and areas for future research that could enhance the usefulness and applicability of prescriptive process monitoring methods. The paper highlights the need to validate existing and new methods in real-world settings, to extend the types of interventions beyond those related to the temporal and cost perspectives, and to design policies that take into account causality and second-order effects.

A DT is a virtual version of a physical product, which can be used in monitoring and developing said physical product. In this report we have discussed how a DT of a Transportable Culture Cabinet (TCC) could be implemented, and its framework. The TCC is being developed at Q-linea and will be used for culturing blood samples for faster diagnosis of sepsis. A DT of a TCC could be used to monitor the status of the sample and the physical product itself. Data from the TCC could also be used by the DT to detect and predict failures of the TCC such as malfunctioning batteries. The TCC can also be referred to as a physical twin and will exist in the physical space, while the DT will exist in the virtual space. An information processing layer (IPL) will connect the physical space and the virtual space. A Digital Twin can either be a Digital Twin Prototype (DTP), a Digital Twin Environment (DTE), a Digital Twin Instance (DTI), or a Digital Twin Aggregate (DTA), which is an aggregation of all the DTIs. In this paper, we have solely focused on DTIs and DTAs. The Digital Twin of the Transportable culture cabinet will be a DTI, and by aggregating all the existing DTIs, or all DTIs belonging to the same hospital, a DTA will be created. Both DTIs and DTAs can be applied with different levels of complexity. Hence, we have proposed three levels of complexity of DTIs and DTAs. There are challenges of using a DT for a TCC. The user interface have to be user friendly for staff that have little IT knowledge. Another challenge is the synchronisation between the TCC and DT. Since the TCC is mobile, a stable internet connection cannot be guaranteed. The TCC should therefore be able to store the most important data.

However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises.

Remaining Time Prediction of process instances is an important task in the field of Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM). Existing approaches have two key limitations in developing Remaining Time Prediction Models (RTM): (1) The features used for predictions lack process context, and the created models are black-boxes. (2) The process instances are considered to be in isolation, despite the fact that process states, e.g., the number of running instances, influence the remaining time of a single process instance. Recent approaches improve the quality of RTMs by utilizing process context related to batching-at-end inter-case dynamics in the process, e.g., using the time to batching as a feature. We propose an approach that decreases the previous approaches\u2019 reliance on user knowledge for discovering fine-grained process behavior. Furthermore, we enrich our RTMs with the extracted features for multiple performance patterns (caused by inter-case dynamics), which increases the interpretability of models. We assess our proposed remaining time prediction method using two real-world event logs. Incorporating the created inter-case features into RTMs results in more accurate and interpretable predictions.

On the one hand, there is the belief that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will solve most problems because of the abundance of data and sophisticated algorithms (LeCun et al. 2015). In this editorial, we use AI\/ML to refer to machine intelligence, i.e., mixtures of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. AI\/ML can deal amazingly well with unstructured data (text, images, and video) as long as there are enough training data. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid climate changes (e.g., the floods in Germany in July 2021) show that AI\/ML cannot deal with disruptions. When there is a sudden dramatic change, predictive models will fail, no matter how much data was there before. Consider, for example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains. Especially at the beginning of the global outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, supply chains failed because of the unpredicted demand for certain products (e.g., masks and toilet paper) combined with simultaneous restrictions for travel, work, and business.

The goal of the PROBLEMS \u201921 workshop is to identify major open problems in Business Process Management (BPM) research that need to be addressed, due to their prominence, complexity, groundbreaking nature, or gain that their solu tion would bring to the whole community. During the workshop, we assumed an ex-post situation in which each of the problems accepted for the workshop had already been solved. Thereupon we discussed in an interactive mode, new algo rithms, techniques, tools, and methodologies that could build upon the solution to that problem. Each submission was reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. The PROBLEMS \u201921 workshop received a total of 25 submissions, out of which the top 9 contributions were accepted for publication. The papers revolve around diverse areas of BPM, including event log data quality, provenance and analysis, process modelling, simulation and design, and value creation and integration. The introductory paper \u201cThe Biggest Business Process Management Problems of Our Time\u201d provides an overview and categori sation of the contributions that follow. We hope the reading of these proceedings will be inspiring and spark new ideas for the research avenues to come in Business Process Management and beyond. To conclude, we would like to express our gratitude to all authors and mem bers of the program committee who contributed to make this event a success.

Various guidelines have been proposed specifically for software engineering experiments. The benefits of such guidelines have often been emphasized, but the actual uptake and practice of reporting have not yet been investigated since the introduction of many of the more recent guidelines. In this research, we utilize a mixed-method study design including sequence analysis techniques for evaluating to which extent papers follow such guidelines. Our study focuses on the four most prominent software engineering journals and the time period from 2000 to 2020. Our results show that many experimental papers miss information suggested by guidelines, that no de facto standard sequence for reporting exists, and that many papers do not cite any guidelines. We discuss these findings and implications for the discipline of experimental software engineering focusing on the review process and the potential to refine and extend guidelines, among others, to account for theory explicitly.

Die DB Systel ist der IT-Partner und ein Tochterunternehmen der Deutschen Bahn AG2 mit Hauptsitz in Frankfurt am Main. Process Mining ist ein relativ junges Feld [Aals16, S.236], die auf Data-Science- und Data-Mining-Methoden aufsetzt und zus\u00e4tzlich um Process-Science-Aspekte erg\u00e4nzt wurde [Aals16, S.17]. Innerhalb kurzer Zeit hat es Process Mining geschafft, sich in zahlreichen Unternehmen zu etablieren. Mithilfe von entsprechenden Tools ist die Nutzung grundlegender Aspekte von Process Mining handhabbar geworden, um digital unterst\u00fctzte Prozesse zu untersuchen, hinreichend zu verstehen und verbessern zu k\u00f6nnen [Lawt19]. Das Process-Mining-Team ist als Berater im gesamten Konzern vertreten und analysiert gemeinsam mit seinen Kunden, den einzelnen Konzerngesellschaften, mithilfe der Process-Mining-Technik, deren Gesch\u00e4ftsprozesse. Dar\u00fcber hinaus unterst\u00fctzen sie den Kunden beim Extrahieren, Transformieren und Laden ihrer Daten sowie beim Bauen von Dashboards in den Process-Mining-Tools. Au\u00dferdem stellen sie die Zug\u00e4nge f\u00fcr die, im Konzern genutzten Tools bereit. Die Personen, die Prozesse in komplexen Kontexten gestalten, sind \u00fcblicherweise keine Datenexperten, jedoch ist dies essenziell, um aus der Vergangenheit zu lernen und Prozesse zu verbessern. Die Hoffnung, die die Deutsche Bahn daher in Process Mining setzt, ist, diesen Nutzergruppen die Daten zug\u00e4nglicher zu machen und damit bei der Optimierung zu unterst\u00fctzen. F\u00fcr die Gesellschaften der Deutschen Bahn ist es schwer zu erkennen, welchen Nutzen eine genauere Untersuchung bestimmter Prozesse generieren k\u00f6nnte. Aufgrund dessen, dass die Deutsche Bahn sich in unterschiedlichen Bereichen bet\u00e4tigt (neben Transport und Logistik u. a.

Dementsprechend wird eine Methodik ben\u00f6tigt, die diese Vergleichbarkeit erleichtert und so Schl\u00fcsse darauf zul\u00e4sst, wie Process Mining einen Nutzen f\u00fcr die Bahngesellschaften generieren kann.

Process mining techniques allow analyzing the event data generated and recorded during the execution of (business) processes to gain valuable insights. Process discovery is a key discipline in process mining that comprises the discovery of process models on the basis of the recorded event data. Most process discovery algorithms work in a fully automated fashion. Apart from adjusting their configuration parameters, conventional process discovery algorithms offer limited to no user interaction, i.e., we either edit the discovered process model by hand or change the algorithm\u2019s input by, for instance, filtering the event data. However, recent work indicates that the integration of domain knowledge in   (semi-)automated  process discovery algorithms often enhances the quality of the process models discovered. Therefore, this paper introduces Cortado, a novel process discovery tool that leverages domain knowledge while incrementally discovering a process model from given event data.

This allows for new functionality as illustrated by modern car navigation systems (e.g., TomTom, Garmin, etc.), Google maps, Google Street View, Mashups using geo-tagging (e.g., Panoramio, HousingMaps, etc.), etc. People can seamlessly zoom in and out using the interactive maps in such systems. Moreover, all kinds of information can be projected on these interactive maps (e.g., traffic jams, four-bedroom apartments for sale, etc.). Process models can be seen as the \u201cmaps\u201d describing the operational processes of organizations. Unfortunately, accurate and interactive process maps are typically missing when it comes to business process management. Either there are no good maps or the maps are static or outdated. Therefore, we propose to automatically generate business process maps using process mining techniques. By doing this, there is a close connection between these maps and the actual behavior recorded in event logs. This will allow for high-quality process models showing what really happened. Moreover, this will also allow for the projection of dynamic information, e.g., the \u201ctraffic jams\u201d in business processes. In fact, the combination of accurate maps, historic information, and information about current process instances, allows for prediction and recommendation. For example, just like TomTom can predict the arrival time at a particular location, process mining techniques can be used to predict when a process instance will finish.

The goal is to build a model (e.g., a Petri net) that provides insight into the behavior captured in the log. The theory of regions can be used to transform a state-based model or a set of words into a Petri net that exactly mimics the behavior given as input. Recently several papers appeared on the application of the theory of regions for process discovery. This paper provides an overview of different Petri net based discovery algorithms from both the area of process mining and the theory of regions. The overview encompasses five categories of algorithms, for which common assumptions and problems are indicated. Furthermore, based on the shortcomings of the algorithms in each category, a set of directions for future research in the process discovery area is discussed.

The core theoretical principles have been studied for many decades and there is now a comprehensive research literature that complements the extensive implementation experience. In this book the author presents a clear, thorough introduction to the essentials of Petri nets. He explains the core modeling techniques and analysis methods and he illustrates their usefulness with examples and case studies. Part I describes how to use Petri nets for modeling; all concepts are explained with the help of examples, starting with a generic, powerful model which is also intuitive and realistic. Part II covers the essential analysis methods that are specific to Petri nets, introducing techniques used to formulate key properties of system nets and algorithms for proving their validity. Part III presents case studies, each introducing new concepts, properties and analysis techniques required for very different modeling tasks. The author offers different paths among the chapters and sections: the elementary strand for readers who wish to study only elementary nets; the modeling strand for those who wish to study the modeling but not the analysis of systems; and finally the elementary models of the modeling strand for those interested in technically simple, but challenging examples and case studies. The author achieves an excellent balance between consistency, comprehensibility and correctness in a book of distinctive design. Among its characteristics, formal arguments are reduced to a minimum in the main text with many of the theoretical formalisms moved to an appendix, the explanations are supported throughout with fully integrated graphical illustrations, and each chapter ends with exercises and recommendations for further reading. The book is suitable for students of computer science and related subjects such as engineering, and for a broad range of researchers and practitioners.

Processes are omnipresent, for example, a manufacturing process which deals with the production of some goods, a loan application process in a bank, a hospital visit of a patient. The human understanding of these processes is usually facilitated by representing them as intuitive graphical models. Typically a domain expert, who has a high level overview of the end-to-end execution of a process, constructs the expected process model. Since these modeling notations offer intuitive visualization of processes, the resulting models have proved to be valuable artifacts to enable communication of complex knowledge in a comprehensible way across people from dissimilar backgrounds. The process model as described by a domain expert is the best guess, of how a process acts, or should act. However, reality may not always conform to this expected behavior of the process. The execution histories of processes, called event logs, can be easily extracted from the corresponding information systems. For example, the event logs of an administrative process can be extracted from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, or the event logs of a careflow process in a hospital can be extracted from the hospitals Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. These event logs provide a view on the execution of processes in reality and can thus be used to discover process models when the process model is unknown, or to analyze the behavior of the process in reality. This branch of science which uses event logs to analyze the process behavior is known as process mining. Process modeling and process mining are typically on the extreme ends of a spectrum. On one end, we have the process mining techniques, which analyze event logs in order to automatically deduce insights, for example discovering process models. The user has very little influence when using such techniques, and usually, it is not possible to incorporate the domain knowledge during process mining. On the other end, we have the traditional process modeling tools which are completely user driven and use no historical evidence from the event logs during process modeling. In the manual process modeling scenario, the user may miss out on important real-life execution information that may be present in the event logs. Whereas the automated process mining techniques may produce results which may be inaccurate and incomprehensible due to noisy and\/or incomplete event logs. In this thesis, we address this gap between the traditional human-driven process modeling world, with the data-driven process mining world, by developing techni- (C) by author(s) or publisher(s)","Date":"2019","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2021-08-04","Pages":null,"NumPages":"294","Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"Eindhoven University of Technology","Place":"Eindhoven","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":"Doctoral","Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":"ISBN 978-90-386-4766-1","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\Q2ZSVS84\\Dixit - 2019 - Interactive process mining.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Conformance Checking; Process Mining; Petri Nets; Process Model; Interactive Process Mining; Workflow Nets","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"U3TDPWZC","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2018.0,"Author":"Y\u00fcrek, \u0130smail; Birant, Derya; Birant, K\u00f6kten Ula\u015f","Title":"Interactive process miner: a new approach for process mining","PublicationTitle":"Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences","ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":"10.3906\/elk-1708-112","Url":"https:\/\/journals.tubitak.gov.tr\/elektrik\/abstract.htm?id=22741","AbstractNote":"Process mining is a technique for extracting knowledge from event logs recorded by an information system. In the process discovery phase of process mining, a process model is constructed to represent the business processes systematically and to give a general opinion about the progressive of processes in the event log. The constructed process model can be very complex as a result of structured and unstructured processes recorded in real life. Previous studies proposed different approaches to filter or eliminate some processes from the model to simplify it by implementing some statistical or mathematical formulas rather than user interactions. The main objective of this study is to develop an algorithm that is capable of working on large volume of event logs and handling the execution records of running process instances to analyze the execution of processes. The other significant principle is to provide an interactive method to ensure the decisions that will be taken to improve the execution of processes by verifying in a simulation environment before being put into practice. This study proposes a novel algorithm, named interactive process miner, to create a process model based on event logs and a new approach that contains three different features, including activity deletion, aggregation, and addition operations on the existing process model. The experimental results show a fundamental improvement in performance compared to the existing algorithms. As a result of this study, users will have an opportunity to analyze a large volume of event logs in a short time with low memory usage and to modify the created process model to observe the impact of improvement changes in a simulation environment before applying any changes to a system in real life.

On the other hand, the IoT poses challenges that will require enhancements and extensions of the current state of the art in the BPM field.

Nowadays, deep-learning-based techniques provide more accurate predictive models. However, the explainability of these models has long been neglected. The predictive quality is essential for PBPM-based decision support systems, but also its explainability for human stakeholders needs to be considered. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) describes different approaches to make machine-learning-based techniques explainable. To examine the current state of explainable PBPM techniques, we perform a structured and descriptive literature review. We identify explainable PBPM techniques of the domain and classify them along with different XAI-related concepts: prediction purpose, intrinsically interpretable or post-hoc, evaluation objective, and evaluation method. Based on our classification, we identify trends in the domain and remaining research gaps.

Although these models provide high levels of accuracy, their sophisticated internal representations provide little or no understanding about the reason for a particular prediction, resulting in them being used as black-boxes. Consequently, an interpretable model is necessary to enable transparency and empower users to evaluate when and how much they can rely on the models. This paper explores an interpretable and accurate attention-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting business process behaviour. The interpretable model provides insights into the model inputs influencing a prediction, thus facilitating transparency. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model capable of supporting interpretability also provides accurate predictions when compared to existing LSTM models for predicting process behaviour. The evaluation further shows that attention mechanisms in LSTM provide a sound approach to generate meaningful interpretations across different tasks in predictive process analytics.

PBPM techniques aim to improve process performance by providing predictions to process analysts, supporting them in their decision making. However, the PBPM techniques` limited predictive quality was considered as the essential obstacle for establishing such techniques in practice. With the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), the techniques` predictive quality could be improved for tasks like the next activity prediction. While DNNs achieve a promising predictive quality, they still lack comprehensibility due to their hierarchical approach of learning representations. Nevertheless, process analysts need to comprehend the cause of a prediction to identify intervention mechanisms that might affect the decision making to secure process performance. In this paper, we propose XNAP, the first explainable, DNN-based PBPM technique for the next activity prediction. XNAP integrates a layer-wise relevance propagation method from the field of explainable artificial intelligence to make predictions of a long short-term memory DNN explainable by providing relevance values for activities. We show the benefit of our approach through two real-life event logs.

As an important branch of state-of-the-art data analytics, business process predictions are also faced with a challenge in regard to the lack of explanation to the reasoning and decision by the underlying `black-box' prediction models. With the development of interpretable machine learning techniques, explanations can be generated for a black-box model, making it possible for (human) users to access the reasoning behind machine learned predictions. In this paper, we aim to present an approach that allows us to use model explanations to investigate certain reasoning applied by machine learned predictions and detect potential issues with the underlying methods thus enhancing trust in business process prediction models. A novel contribution of our approach is the proposal of model inspection that leverages both the explanations generated by interpretable machine learning mechanisms and the contextual or domain knowledge extracted from event logs that record historical process execution. Findings drawn from this work are expected to serve as a key input to developing model reliability metrics and evaluation in the context of business process predictions.

As a result, the digital and the physical world are closely aligned, and it is possible to track operational processes in detail (e.g., using sensors). The abundance of event data generated by today\u2019s operational processes provides opportunities and challenges for process mining techniques supporting process discovery, performance analysis, and conformance checking. Using existing process mining tools, it is already possible to automatically discover process models and uncover performance and compliance problems. In the DFG-funded Cluster of Excellence \u201cInternet of Production\u201d (IoP), process mining is used to create \u201cdigital shadows\u201d to improve a wide variety of operational processes. However, operational processes are dynamic, distributed, and complex. Driven by the challenges identified in the IoP cluster, we work on novel techniques for comparative process mining (comparing process variants for different products at different locations at different times), object-centric process mining (to handle processes involving different types of objects that interact), and forward-looking process mining (to explore \u201cWhat if?\u201d questions). By addressing these challenges, we aim to develop valuable \u201cdigital shadows\u201d that can be used to remove operational friction.

Applications of machine learning in speech recognition (e.g., Alexa and Siri), image recognition, automated translation, autonomous driving, and medical diagnosis, have blurred the classical divide between human tasks and machine tasks. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies outperform humans in many areas, tasks requiring common sense, contextual knowledge, creativity, adaptivity, and empathy are still best performed by humans. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) blends human intelligence and machine intelligence to combine the best of both worlds. Hence, current and future Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives need to consider HI and the changing boundaries between work done by people and work done by software robots. Consider, for example, the success of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which demonstrates that gradually taking away repetitive tasks from workers is possible. In this viewpoint paper, we argue that process mining is a key technology to decide what to automate and what not. Moreover, using process mining, it is possible to systematically monitor and manage processes where work is distributed over human workers and software robots.

Some scholars have argued that experimental evaluations should be conducted, others emphasize the benefits of formal analysis. We believe that this debate less of a question of either-or, because both views can be integrated into an overarching framework. It is the ambition of this paper to develop such a framework of algorithm engineering with a theoretical foundation in the philosophy of science. We take the empirical nature of algorithm engineering as a starting point. Our theoretical framework builds on three areas discussed in the philosophy of science: ontology, epistemology and methodology. In essence, ontology describes algorithm engineering as being concerned with algorithmic problems, algorithmic tasks, algorithm designs and algorithm implementations. Epistemology describes the body of knowledge of algorithm engineering as a collection of prescriptive and descriptive knowledge, residing in World 3 of Popper's Three Worlds model. Methodology refers to the steps how we can systematically enhance our knowledge of specific algorithms. In this context, we identified seven validity concerns and discuss how researchers can respond to falsification. Our framework has important implications for researching algorithms in various areas of computer science.

Prior studies have provided insights into the benefits of digital twins that combined both data and simulation approaches; however, there remains a managerial gap. The purpose of this paper is to explore this research gap using input from a multiple case study research design from both manufacturing environments and non-manufacturing environments. The authors use ten cases to explore how digital twins support value co-creation through decision-making. The authors were all involved in the development of the ten cases. Individual biases were removed by using the literature to provide the assessment dimensions and allowing a convergence of the results. Drawing on the lessons from the ten cases, this study empirically identified eight managerial issues that need to be considered when developing digital twins to support multi-stakeholder decision-making that leads to value co-creation. The application of digital twins in value co-creation and decision-making is a topic that has developed from practice and is an area where a research gap exists between theory and practice. A cross-case analysis was developed based on the literature and the ten cases (eight industrial and two pilot-scale cases) providing the empirical findings. The findings describe how firms can design, develop, and commercialize digital-twin-enabled value propositions and will initiate future research.

Process mining analysis provides an idea about a general process by comparing each process with others in the terms of time and responsible people who deal with the process. For this reason, event logs are checked. Event logs consist of large data. Because the event logs keep all the records that occur during short time intervals. Special programs are needed to examine such data. These programs generate a process map using information such as event ID, activity, time and responsible person. Through the analysis, processes are discovered, monitored and improved. In this study, the tools named ProM, Disco, Celonis and My-Invenio used in process mining were examined and their performance according to usage features compared. According to the obtained results, the usefulness, performance and reporting features of the software used in a process analysis are revealed.

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud\/edge computing integration. This work sets out to be a guide to the status of DT development and application in today\u2019s academic and industrial environment.

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.

Such integration, which is called Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), is transforming the industry into the next level. CPS facilitates the systematic transformation of massive data into information, which makes the invisible patterns of degradations and inefficiencies visible and yields to optimal decision-making. This paper focuses on existing trends in the development of industrial big data analytics and CPS. Then it briefly discusses a systematic architecture for applying CPS in manufacturing called 5C. The 5C architecture includes necessary steps to fully integrate cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing industry. Finally, a case study for designing smart machines through the 5C CPS architecture is presented.

However, cloud architectures are in place, or more commonly, CPS-based modules communicate through IoT technology, implicating security (data-related) and safety (concerning proper control enforcement). With respect to Thermal Processes, and in particular Laser Welding, this work studies the effect of encoding on Process Control efficiency.

As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications. Research status, evolution of the concept, key enabling technologies of three aspects, and fifteen kinds of industrial applications in respective lifecycle phase are demonstrated in detail. Based on this, observations and future work recommendations for digital twin research are presented in the form of different lifecycle phases.

Knowledge generated by experts and artificial intelligence, is transformed into formal business rules and integrated into the DS to enable the characterization of the real behavior of the physical system throughout its operation stage. This behavior model is continuously enriched by direct or derived learning, in order to improve the digital twin. The proposed DS relies on data analytics (based on unsupervised learning) and on a knowledge inference engine. It enables the incidents to be detected and it is also able to decipher its operational context. An example of this application in the aeronautic machining industry is provided to stress both the feasibility of the proposition and its potential impact on shop floor performance.

Previous studies have revealed welding temperature to be a decisive factor for joint quality. Consequently, several temperature control systems for FSW have been developed. These output feedback control systems usually require delicate and expensive temperature measuring equipment, which reduces their suitability for industrial practice. This paper presents a novel state feedback system of the welding temperature to remedy this shortcoming. The system uses a physical model of the FSW process (digital twin) for the determination of the welding temperature signal from the process torque signal. The digital twin is based on a multi-input nonlinear time invariant model, which is fed with the torque signal from the spindle motor. A model-based \u21121 adaptive controller was employed for its robustness with respect to model inaccuracies and fast adaption to fluctuations in the controlled system. The experimental validation of the feedback control system showed improved weld quality compared to welded joints produced without temperature control. The achieved control accuracies depended on the results of the temperature calculation. Control deviations of less than 10 K could be achieved for certain welding parameters, and even for a work piece geometry, which deliberately caused heat accumulation.

Then it presents an innovative application framework of a digital twin-driven ship intelligent manufacturing system and analyzes its operation mechanism. The application framework of a digital twin-driven ship intelligent manufacturing system mainly includes five parts: the physical layer, model layer, data layer, system layer, and application layer. Finally, key enabling techniques, as well as a case study in a pipe machining production line, are constructed and studied to validate the proposed approach.

Ebook | The Process Manufacturing Digital TwinDigital Transformation has become the overarching topic among executive leadership in most manufacturing companies today. The batch and continuous process manufacturing companies and other asset-intensive industries such as mining, energy, utilities, and transportation, believe that the Digital Twin should be at the center of Digital Transformation efforts. This has led the technology community to focus messaging around twins at all levels, from automation companies to enterprise software providers and infrastructure suppliers.  But unlike discrete manufacturing, the process and asset-intensive industries have no commonly accepted definition of a Digital Twin. The challenge that many manufacturing organizations face is understanding exactly what a Digital Twin is (and what it is not) and how the industrial enterprise can gain competitive advantage using them.

In smart manufacturing, a digital twin, also referred to as a cyber-physical production system, comprises three integrated components: the product, the process and the machine. In this paper, the design, fabrication and development of a proof of principal manufacturing digital twin demonstrator is discussed. The manufacturing process is a V-bending operation of a thin metallic plate. All three components of a manufacturing digital twin are represented: the metallic plate product, the bending process and the bending machine. Low-cost, IoT-enabled, open-source microcontrollers are used to communicate between the physical and the digital twins. The microcontroller is used to control machine operations, while also extracting sensor data from the system. It is demonstrated that the digital twin enables real-time stress prediction in the product during the bending process, while also tracking and recording machine performance.

For successful implementation of digitalization, manufacturing companies must consider their existing technical systems, organizational structures, and processes, as well as social aspects. With the support of a maturity model, a company-specific digitalization level can be evaluated to provide manufacturing companies with an initial insight into their particular status quo; this can serve as a starting point for future optimization and digitalization projects. Furthermore, the results of such an analysis allow objective comparison of different areas within the company and with competitors. In this paper, the \u201cIntegrierte Arbeitssystemgestaltung in digitalisierten Produktionsunternehmen\u201d (InAsPro) maturity model is presented, which considers the               Development               ,               Production               , and               Assembly               product lifecycle phases, as well as               Aftersales               , and assesses their digitalization level focusing on the four dimensions of               Technology               ,               Organization               ,               Social Issues               , and               Corporate Strategy               . The maturity model\u2019s rating scale distinguishes between four maturity levels. The results given by the InAsPro maturity model for an entire company are presented, along with those for each product lifecycle phase.

Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems.

It is the emergence of digital twin that become one of the solution to this bottleneck. In this paper, a system framework of digital twin workshop is proposed. In the light of the framework, a model of digital twin workshop based on physical perception data is established. This model is divided into three parts, which including workshop physical model, digital model based on ontology, and virtual model. Moreover, the operation mechanism of digital twin workshop is described among the three models. Finally, a three-dimensional model for a production line is built, and the connection between digital and virtual layer is established and demonstrated.

It assesses the opportunities that DT can offer for smart cities, and covers the requirements for ensuring secure, safe and sustainable smart cities. Further, the book demonstrates that DT and its benefits with regard to: data visualisation, real-time data analytics, and learning leading to improved confidence in decision making; reasoning, monitoring and warning to support accurate diagnostics and prognostics; acting using edge control and what-if analysis; and connection with back-end business applications hold significant potential for applications in smart cities, by employing a wide range of sensory and data-acquisition systems in various parts of the urban infrastructure. The contributing authors reveal how and why DT technologies that are used for monitoring, visualising, diagnosing and predicting in real-time are vital to cities\u2019 sustainability and efficiency. The concepts outlined in the book represents a city together with all of its infrastructure elements, which communicate with each other in a complex manner. Moreover, securing Internet of Things (IoT) which is one of the key enablers of DT\u2019s is discussed in details and from various perspectives. The book offers an outstanding reference guide for practitioners and researchers in manufacturing, operations research and communications, who are considering digitising some of their assets and related services. It is also a valuable asset for graduate students and academics who are looking to identify research gaps and develop their own proposals for further research.

In the manufacturing context, it is possible to utilise the Cloud technology to integrate and provide industrial resources and capabilities in terms of Cloud services. In this paper, a function block-based integration mechanism is developed to connect various types of production resources. A Cloud-based architecture is also deployed to offer a service pool which maintains these resources as production services. The proposed system provides a flexible and integrated information environment for the Cloud-based production system. As a specific type of manufacturing, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) remanufacturing experiences difficulties in system integration, information exchange and resource management. In this research, WEEE is selected as the example of Internet of Things to demonstrate how the obstacles and bottlenecks are overcome with the help of Cloud-based informatics approach. In the case studies, the WEEE recycle\/recovery capabilities are also integrated and deployed as flexible Cloud services. Supporting mechanisms and technologies are presented and evaluated towards the end of the paper.

These systems typically record a large amount of event data about the organization's day-to-day business. Organizations are interested in analyzing this data to optimize their business processes. Process mining is a research field that analyzes event data to obtain valuable knowledge about how processes are executed in reality. Different from conventional interview-based methods, process mining analyzes the process performance and compliance solely based on recorded event data. Currently, the work of analysts using process mining tools is characterized as largely manual, leading to many ad-hoc tasks. With the growth of available event data and the increasing complexity of processes, several issues emerge in practice. Many process mining methods are not specifically designed for large event logs, leading to high computation time and a substantial amount of manual work. Consequently, suitable subsets of cases must be selected before applying certain analysis tasks successfully. Furthermore, applying process mining techniques to unknown event data often requires extensive domain knowledge and process mining expertise to obtain valuable insights. Although efforts were made to systematize the manual work of analysts in process mining projects, current tools lack intelligent computer-assisted guidance. This dissertation introduces several contributions to different steps along an analyst's workflow to address the above issues. It is divided into three major parts: The first part introduces a process knowledge artifact framework that simplifies data extraction and processing of heterogeneous data sources as an enabling preparatory step towards process mining. In the second part, the dissertation introduces three algorithms specifically designed for large and complex real-life event logs. A novel compliance checking algorithm significantly improves runtime performance for large event logs to identify compliance rule violations. A parameter-free process drift detection algorithm automatically detects changes in the process execution over time to reveal potential process issues. A novel multi-perspective trace clustering algorithm automatically detects patterns in the control flow and the data perspective of a process to reveal the different process behaviors in event logs, aiming at simplifying process discovery. The third part of the dissertation integrates the contributions made in the first two parts and introduces an interactive visual recommendation approach to enhance process analysis guidance. Lastly, a process improvement approach is presented, suggesting modifications to process models for a given improvement goal. The proposed algorithms and methods were evaluated with synthetic and real-life event logs, demonstrating their superior qualitative performance and practical feasibility. A user study conducted with process mining experts evaluated the prototype implementation of the interactive visual recommendation system to assess the usefulness in the process analysis workflow.

Understanding time-oriented data enables us to learn from the past in order to predict, plan, and build the future. Due to the distinct characteristics of time, appropriate visual and analytical methods are required to explore and analyze them. This book starts with an introduction to visualization and a number of historical examples of visual representations. At its core, the book presents and discusses a systematic view of the visualization of time-oriented data. This view is structured along three key questions. While the aspects of time and associated data describe what is being visualized, user tasks are related to the question why something is visualized. These characteristics and tasks determine how the visualization is to be designed. To support visual exploration, interaction techniques and analytical methods are required as well, which are discussed in separate chapters. The concepts explained in this book are illustrated with numerous examples. A large part of this book is devoted to a structured survey of existing techniques for visualizing time and time-oriented data. Overall, 101 different visualization techniques are presented on a per-page basis; each of these self-contained descriptions is accompanied by an illustration and corresponding references.  This survey serves as a reference for scientists conducting related research as well as for practitioners seeking information on how their time-oriented data can best be visualized in order to gain valuable insights.

Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called \"workflow log\" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the \/spl alpha\/-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.

Existing process prediction methods are able to also exploit the data perspective of recorded events, in addition to the control-flow perspective. However, while well-structured numerical or categor\\-ical attributes are considered in many prediction techniques, almost no technique is able to utilize text documents written in natural language, which can hold information critical to the prediction task. In this paper, we illustrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel \\emph{text-aware process prediction model} based on \\emph{Long Short-Term Memory} (LSTM) neural networks and natural language models. The proposed model can take categorical, numerical and textual attributes in event data into account to predict the activity and timestamp of the next event, the outcome, and the cycle time of a running process instance. Experiments show that the text-aware model is able to outperform state-of-the-art process prediction methods on simulated and real-world event logs containing textual data.

Process mining offers an innovative digital approach that combines data mining, analytics and process optimization. Supported by real data, it provides valuable, detailed insights into a company's operational and administrative processes and sheds light on where to improve them. Given the increasing relevance of this data-driven approach, we created a global survey to ask process mining practitioners and relevant decision makers if they already embarked on the process mining journey and to what extend they are currently using process mining. Furthermore, we wanted to pinpoint which value process mining has brought to companies and identify the success factors for scaling process mining.

By leveraging recent developments in information systems research, the paper addresses manufacturing systems with high process complexity and variety. Specifically, the proposed procedure draws upon process mining to dynamically map and analyse manufacturing processes in an automated manner. This way, manufacturers can leverage data to overcome the limitations of existing process mapping methods, which only provide static snapshots of process flows. By bridging data and process science, process mining can exploit hitherto untapped potential for productivity improvement. The proposed procedure is empirically validated at a leading manufacturer of sanitary products. The field test leads to three concrete improvement suggestions for the company. This research contributes to the literature on production research by demonstrating a novel use of process mining in manufacturing and by guiding practitioners in its implementation.

Process mining techniques helped in the discovery of changes in the Emergency Departments. Some illnesses, such as heat stroke, are more prevalent during heatwaves, but more interestingly, the time to attend patients is also higher.

Event logs are recorded by information systems and contain valuable information helping organizations to improve their processes. However, these data also include highly sensitive private information which is a major concern when applying process mining. Therefore, privacy preservation in process mining is growing in importance, and new techniques are being introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed privacy preservation techniques needs to be evaluated. It is important to measure both sensitive data protection and data utility preservation. In this paper, we propose an approach to quantify the effectiveness of privacy preservation techniques. We introduce two measures for quantifying disclosure risks to evaluate the sensitive data protection aspect. Moreover, a measure is proposed to quantify data utility preservation for the main process mining activities. The proposed measures have been tested using various real-life event logs.

Faced with such data, process discovery often produces incomprehensible spaghetti-models expressed at a granularity level that doesn\u2019t match the mental model of a business user. One approach is to use event abstraction patterns to transform the event log towards a more coarse-grained level and to discover process models from this transformed log. Recent literature has produced various (partial) implementations of this approach, but insights how these techniques compare against each other is still limited. This paper focuses on the use of Local Process Models and Combination based Behavioural Pattern Mining to discover event abstraction patterns in combination with the approach of Mannhardt et al. [15] to transform the event log. Experiments are conducted to gain insights into the performance of these techniques. Results are very limited with a general decrease in fitness and precision and only a minimal improvement of complexity. Results also show that the combination of the process discovery algorithm and the event abstraction pattern miner matters. In particular, the combination of Local Process Models with Split Miner seems to improve precision.

These records can be extracted in the form of event logs, which capture the execution of activities across multiple instances of a business process. Event logs may be used to analyze business processes at a fine level of detail using process mining techniques. Among other things, process mining techniques allow us to discover a process model from an event log \u2013 an operation known as automated process discovery. Despite a rich body of research in the field, existing automated process discovery techniques do not fully capture the concurrency inherent in a business process. Specifically, the bulk of these techniques treat two activities A and B as concurrent if sometimes A completes before B and other times B completes before A. Typically though, activities in a business process are executed in a true concurrency setting, meaning that two or more activity executions overlap temporally. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a refined version of an automated process discovery technique, namely Split Miner, that discovers true concurrency relations from event logs containing start and end timestamps for each activity. The proposed technique is also able to differentiate between exclusive and inclusive choices. We evaluate the proposed technique relative to existing baselines using 11 real-life logs drawn from different industries.

However, in many cases, the event data generated during the execution of a process is at a much lower level of abstraction, e.g., sensor data. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel technique that allows us to translate sensor data into higher-level, discrete event data, thus enabling existing process mining techniques to work on data tracked at a sensory level. Our technique discretises the observed sensor data into activities by applying unsupervised learning in the form of clustering. Furthermore, we refine the observed sequences by deducing imperative sub-models for the observed discretised data, i.e., allowing us to identify concurrency and interleaving within the data. We evaluated the approach by comparing the obtained model quality for several clustering techniques on a publicly available data-set in a smart home scenario. Our results show that applying our framework combined with a clustering technique yields results on data that otherwise would not be suitable for process discovery.

This paper proposes an approach that exploits a commonly available and versatile source of data, i.e. database redo logs. Such logs record the writing operations performed in a general-purpose database for a range of objects, which constitute a collection of events. By using the relations between objects as specified in the associated data model, it is possible to turn such events into an event log for a wide range of case types. The resulting logs can be analyzed using existing process mining techniques.

This dynamic behavior particularly requires well documented processes, but at the same time it also complicates process documentation. Manually documented processes can, e.g., miss details of alternative process branches, and the continuing change in logistic processes renders the documentation quickly outdated. A possible solution approach is to automate the documentation of processes. This automated documentation, if based on transaction and master data from the IT systems connected to the logistic process, is called Process Mining. Being a subfield of Data Mining, Process Mining extracts sequences of activities from event logs in databases. Logistics has the opportunity to greatly benefit from the application of Process Mining, because the identification and tracking of goods in the supply chain involves many IT systems. However, the IT landscape in logistics is heterogeneous, because the data are scattered among different specialized systems for various purposes (e.g., warehousing, transportation planning, and billing) of different companies. Due to this lack of standardization, the data cannot simply be analyzed by a predefined routine. Therefore, additional information beside the stored data should be taken into consideration. Machine Learning offers the possibility to classify single items in large data sets and to categorize these items with regard to the context they are in. Adding context awareness to unstructured event data in logistics has the potential to improve the results of Process Mining. Our research investigates how to apply context awareness based on Machine Learning in Process Mining for logistic processes and demonstrates its performance in a logistic scenario.

The quality of the data (both form and content) presented to the modeling algorithms is critical to the success of the process mining exercise. Cleaning event logs to address quality issues prior to conducting a process mining analysis is a necessary, but generally tedious and ad hoc task. In this paper we describe a set of data quality issues, distilled from our experiences in conducting process mining analyses, commonly found in process mining event logs or encountered while preparing event logs from raw data sources. We show that patterns are used in a variety of domains as a means for describing commonly encountered problems and solutions. The main contributions of this article are in showing that a patterns-based approach is applicable to documenting commonly encountered event log quality issues, the formulation of a set of components for describing event log quality issues as patterns, and the description of a collection of 11 event log imperfection patterns distilled from our experiences in preparing event logs. We postulate that a systematic approach to using such a pattern repository to identify and repair event log quality issues benefits both the process of preparing an event log and the quality of the resulting event log. The relevance of the pattern-based approach is illustrated via application of the patterns in a case study and through an evaluation by researchers and practitioners in the field.

For structured processes without too many variations, it is possible to show a relative simple model and project performance and conformance information on it. However, if there are multiple classes of cases exhibiting markedly different behaviors, then the overall process will be too complex to interpret. Moreover, it will be impossible to see differences in performance and conformance for the different process variants. The different process variations should be analysed separately and compared to each other from different perspectives to obtain meaningful insights about the different behaviors embedded in the process. This paper formalizes the notion of process cubes where the event data is presented and organized using different dimensions. Each cell in the cube corresponds to a set of events which can be used as an input by any process mining technique. This notion is related to the well-known OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) data cubes, adapting the OLAP paradigm to event data through multidimensional process mining. This adaptation is far from trivial given the nature of event data which cannot be easily summarized or aggregated, conflicting with classical OLAP assumptions. For example, multidimensional process mining can be used to analyze the different versions of a sales processes, where each version can be defined according to different dimensions such as location or time, and then the different results can be compared. This new way of looking at processes may provide valuable insights for process optimization.

The literature acknowledges the potential benefits of using process mining techniques in Six Sigma-based process improvement initiatives. However, a guideline that is explicitly dedicated on how process mining can be systematically used in Six Sigma initiatives is lacking. To address this gap, the Process Mining for Six Sigma (PMSS) guideline has been developed to support organizations in systematically using process mining techniques aligned with the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) model of Six Sigma. Following a design science research methodology, PMSS and its tool support have been developed iteratively in close collaboration with experts in Six Sigma and process mining, and evaluated by means of focus groups, demonstrations and interviews with industry experts. The results of the evaluations indicate that PMSS is useful as a guideline to support Six Sigma-based process improvement activities. It offers a structured guideline for practitioners by extending the DMAIC-based standard operating procedure. PMSS can help increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of Six Sigma-based process improving efforts. This work extends the body of knowledge in the fields of process mining and Six Sigma, and helps closing the gap between them. Hence, it contributes to the broad field of quality management.

Process mining uses databases of existing IT systems to gain major insights in processes. Currently the AECFM industry increasingly adapts IT systems within all phases of the process. This creates the possibility to use process mining techniques to gain insight in the processes of construction projects. This paper introduces process mining by presenting three experimental case studies which are conducted in order to study the applicability of process mining in the AECFM. Studies are done in the design-, build- and operational phase. The study has proven to provide useful insight and potential applications. The research method that was used does not allow generalisation of the conclusions for the whole industry. Additional research is needed to study the potential of integrating different data sources from several phases.

The BPM Billboard is grounded in the belief that BPM is a means to an end, not the end itself. It links BPM initiatives to strategic objectives and ensures that BPM creates tangible results towards achieving those objectives by systematically developing the required, context-specific organizational capabilities. The BPM Billboard structures everything that needs to be considered for BPM initiatives to be successful and provides a cockpit view allowing process managers to omprehensively plan, manage, assess, and communicate BPM initiatives. As  such, the BPM Billboard also serves as a framework for the many BPM cases presented in this book. In this chapter, we introduce the BPM Billboard and provide a practical example to demonstrate its applicability. Furthermore, we outline how to use the BPM Billboard in process work. Finally, we explain how the cases in this book relate to the BPM Billboard and  provide a brief overview of the cases discussed in the individual chapters that follow.

This allows us to benefit from both the performance of existing process discovery methods, and the accuracy of the employed fundamental synthesis techniques. We prove that the proposed approach preserves fitness with respect to the event log, while improving the precision when indirect dependencies exist. The approach has been implemented and tested on both synthetic and real-life datasets. The results show its effectiveness in repairing process models discovered from event logs.

The increasing amount of event logs in organizations challenges current process mining techniques, which tend to load data into the memory of a computer. This issue limits the organizations to apply process mining on a large scale and introduces risks due to the lack of data management capabilities. Therefore, this paper introduces and formalizes a new approach to store and retrieve event logs into\/from graph databases. It defines an algorithm to compute Directly Follows Graph (DFG) inside the graph database, which shifts the heavy computation parts of process mining into the graph database. Calculating DFG in graph databases enables leveraging the graph databases' horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities in favor of applying process mining on a large scale. Besides, it removes the requirement to move data into analysts' computer. Thus, it enables using data management capabilities in graph databases. We implemented this approach in Neo4j and evaluated its performance compared with current techniques using a real log file. The result shows that our approach enables the calculation of DFG when the data is much bigger than the computational memory. It also shows better performance when dicing data into small chunks.

Due to the shared nature of blockchains, understanding the usage of blockchain-based applications and the underlying network is crucial. Although log analysis is a well-established means, data extraction from blockchain platforms can be highly inconvenient and slow, not least due to the absence of logging libraries. To close the gap, we here introduce the Ethereum Logging Framework (ELF) which is highly configurable and available as open source. ELF supports users (i) in generating cost-efficient logging code readily embeddable into smart contracts and (ii) in extracting log analysis data into common formats regardless of whether the code generation has been used during development. We provide an overview of and rationale for the framework's features, outline implementation details, and demonstrate ELF's versatility based on three case studies from the public Ethereum blockchain.

In order to fully exploit the opportunities opened by RPA, companies need to discover which specific routines may be automated, and how. In this setting, this paper addresses the problem of analyzing User Interaction (UI) logs in order to discover routines where a user transfers data from one spreadsheet or (Web) form to another. The paper maps this problem to that of discovering data transformations by example - a problem for which several techniques are available. The paper shows that a naive application of a state-of-the-art technique for data transformation discovery is computationally inefficient. Accordingly, the paper proposes two optimizations that take advantage of the information in the UI log and the fact that data transfers across applications typically involve copying alphabetic and numeric tokens separately. The proposed approach and its optimizations are evaluated using UI logs that replicate a real-life repetitive data transfer routine.

The discovered models are used for analysis and come with a graphical flowchart-like representation that supports their comprehension by analysts. According to the Occam\u2019s Razor principle, a model should encode the process behavior with as few constructs as possible, that is, it should not be overcomplicated without necessity. The simpler the graphical representation, the easier the described behavior can be understood by a stakeholder. Conversely, and intuitively, a complex representation should be harder to understand. Although various conformance checking techniques that relate the behavior of discovered models to the behavior recorded in event logs have been proposed, there are no methods for evaluating whether this behavior is represented in the simplest possible way. Existing techniques for measuring the simplicity of discovered models focus on their structural characteristics such as size or density, and ignore the behavior these models encoded. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework that can be instantiated into a concrete approach for estimating the simplicity of a model, considering the behavior the model describes, thus allowing a more holistic analysis. The reported evaluation over real-life event logs for several instantiations of the framework demonstrates its feasibility in practice.

They are specifically interesting for process mining because they allow capturing complex behavior in a compact way. A key research challenge for the proliferation of mixed-paradigm models for process mining is the lack of corresponding conformance checking techniques. In this paper, we address this problem by devising the first approach that works with intertwined state spaces of mixed-paradigm models. More specifically, our approach uses an alignment-based replay to explore the state space and compute trace fitness in a procedural way. In every state, the declarative constraints are separately updated, such that violations disable the corresponding activities. Our technique provides for an efficient replay towards an optimal alignment by respecting all orthogonal Declare constraints. We have implemented our technique in ProM and demonstrate its performance in an evaluation with real-world event logs.

This typically happens when dealing with streaming data or when the event log extraction process cuts the end of the trace. The existence of truncated traces in event logs and their negative impacts on process mining outcomes have been widely acknowledged in the literature. Still, there is a lack of research on algorithms to detect them. We propose the Truncated Trace Classifier (TTC), an algorithm that distinguishes truncated traces from the ones that are not truncated. We benchmark 5 TTC implementations that use either LSTM or XGBOOST on 13 real-life event logs. Accurate TTCs have great potential. In fact, filtering truncated traces before applying a process discovery algorithm greatly improves the precision of the discovered process models, by 9.1%. Moreover, we show that TTCs increase the accuracy of a next event prediction algorithm by up to 7.5%.

A few studies have suggested that the accuracy of automated process discovery approaches can be enhanced by means of metaheuristic optimization techniques. However, these studies have remained at the level of proposals without validation on real-life datasets or they have only considered one metaheuristic in isolation. This article presents a metaheuristic optimization framework for automated process discovery. The key idea of the framework is to construct a directly-follows graph (DFG) from the event log, to perturb this DFG so as to generate new candidate solutions, and to apply a DFG-based automated process discovery approach in order to derive a process model from each DFG. The framework can be instantiated by linking it to an automated process discovery approach, an optimization metaheuristic, and the quality measure to be optimized (e.g., fitness, precision, F-score). The article considers several instantiations of the framework corresponding to four optimization metaheuristics, three automated process discovery approaches (Inductive Miner\u2014directly-follows, Fodina, and Split Miner), and one accuracy measure (Markovian F-score). These framework instances are compared using a set of 20 real-life event logs. The evaluation shows that metaheuristic optimization consistently yields visible improvements in F-score for all the three automated process discovery approaches, at the cost of execution times in the order of minutes, versus seconds for the baseline approaches.

Filtering techniques are specifically helpful to tackle this problem. These techniques have been focusing on leaving out infrequent aspects of the process which are considered outliers. However, it is exactly in these outliers where it is possible to gather important insights on the process. This paper addresses this problem by defining multi-range filtering. Our technique not only allows to combine both frequent and non-frequent aspects of the process but it supports any user-defined intervals of frequency of activities and variants. We evaluate our approach through a prototype based on the PM4Py library and show the benefits in comparison to existing filtering techniques.

Business process mining takes these logs to discover process, control, data, organizational, and social structures. Although many researchers are developing new and more powerful process mining techniques and software vendors are incorporating these in their software, few of the more advanced process mining techniques have been tested on real-life processes. This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular.  (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The process discovery algorithms tend to use the whole event data. When dealing with large event data, it is no longer feasible to use standard hardware in a limited time. A straightforward approach to overcome this problem is to down-size the data utilizing a random sampling method. However, little research has been conducted on selecting the right sample, given the available time and characteristics of event data. This paper systematically evaluates various biased sampling methods and evaluates their performance on different datasets using four different discovery techniques. Our experiments show that it is possible to considerably speed up discovery techniques using biased sampling without losing the resulting process model quality. Furthermore, due to the implicit filtering (removing outliers) obtained by applying the sampling technique, the model quality may even be improved.

We demonstrate this by using a range of quality measures for both event data and discovered process models. This paper is a call to the community of IS engineers to complement their process discovery algorithms with properties that relate qualities of their inputs to those of their outputs. To this end, we distinguish four incremental stages for the development of such algorithms, along with concrete guidelines for the formulation of relevant properties and experimental validation. We will also use these stages to reflect on the state of the art, which shows the need to move forward in our thinking about algorithmic process discovery.

This, in turn, allows analysts to compare alternative options to improve a business process. A common roadblock for business process simulation is that constructing accurate simulation models is cumbersome and error-prone. Modern information systems store detailed execution logs of the business processes they support. Previous work has shown that these logs can be used to discover simulation models. However, existing methods for log-based discovery of simulation models do not seek to optimize the accuracy of the resulting models. Instead they leave it to the user to manually tune the simulation model to achieve the desired level of accuracy. This article presents an accuracy-optimized method to discover business process simulation models from execution logs. The method decomposes the problem into a series of steps with associated configuration parameters. A hyper-parameter optimization method is used to search through the space of possible configurations so as to maximize the similarity between the behavior of the simulation model and the behavior observed in the log. The method has been implemented as a tool and evaluated using logs from different domains.

Conformance checking aims to uncover differences between a process model and an event log. Many conformance checking techniques and measures have been proposed. Typically, these take into account the frequencies of traces in the event log, but do not consider the probabilities of these traces in the model. This asymmetry leads to various complications. Therefore, we define conformance for stochastic process models taking into account frequencies and routing probabilities. We use the earth movers\u2019 distance between stochastic languages representing models and logs as an intuitive conformance notion. In this paper, we show that this form of stochastic conformance checking enables detailed diagnostics projected on both model and log. To pinpoint differences and relate these to specific model elements, we extend the so-called \u2018reallocation matrix\u2019 to consider paths. The approach has been implemented in ProM and our evaluations show that stochastic conformance checking is possible in real-life settings.

Process discovery, conformance checking, model enhancement, and operational support are used to improve performance and compliance. Process mining starts from recorded events that are characterized by a case identifier, an activity name, a timestamp, and optional attributes like resource or costs. In many applications, there are multiple candidate identifiers leading to different views on the same process. Moreover, one event may be related to different cases (convergence) and, for a given case, there may be multiple instances of the same activity within a case (divergence). To create a traditional process model, the event data need to be \u201cflattened\u201d. There are typically multiple choices possible, leading to different views that are disconnected. Therefore, one quickly loses the overview and event data need to be exacted multiple times (for the different views). Different approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem. This paper discusses the gap between real event data and the event logs required by traditional process mining techniques. The main purpose is to create awareness and to provide ways to characterize event data. A specific logging format is proposed where events can be related to objects of different types. Moreover, basic notations and a baseline discovery approach are presented to facilitate discussion and understanding.

Processes in these domains are typically represented as process diagrams or flow charts. So far, various techniques have been developed for automatically generating such diagrams from event sequence data. An open challenge is the visual analysis of drift phenomena when processes change over time. In this paper, we address this research gap. Our contribution is a system for fine-granular process drift detection and corresponding visualizations for event logs of executed business processes. We evaluated our system both on synthetic and real-world data. On synthetic logs, we achieved an average F-score of 0.96 and outperformed all the state-of-the-art methods. On real-world logs, we identified all types of process drifts in a comprehensive manner. Finally, we conducted a user study highlighting that our visualizations are easy to use and useful as perceived by process mining experts. In this way, our work contributes to research on process mining, event sequence analysis, and visualization of temporal data.

Processes are specifically discussed from the angle of simplicity, i.e., how compact and easy to understand they can be represented. In most cases, organizations rely on imperative models which, how-ever, become complex and cluttered when it comes to flexibility and optionality. As an alternative, declarative modeling reveals to be effective under such cir-cumstances. While both approaches are well known for themselves, there is still not a deep understanding of their semantic interoperability. With this work, we examine the latter and show how to obtain an imperative model out of a set of declarative constraints. To this aim, we devise an approach leading from a De-clare model to a behaviorally equivalent Petri net. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any declarative control flow can be represented by means of a Petri net for which the property of safety always holds true.

Poor patient flows manifest as overcrowding in the ED, prolonged length of stay (LoS), patients \u201cboarding\u201d in EDs and \u201caccess block\u201d for admission to inpatient wards. Consequences include poor patient outcomes, reduced access for new patients who present at the ED, and negative effects on staff, including dissatisfaction and stress. Further motivation for improving patient flows in EDs arises because Commonwealth- and state-sponsored financial incentives for hospitals are tied to achieving targets for improved patient access to emergency services. One measure of such improved access is meeting nationally agreed targets for the percentage of patients who are physically discharged from the ED within 4 h of arrival. (b) Action taken A key challenge in deriving evidence-based improvements for patient flows is that of gaining insight into the process factors and context factors that affect patient flows. The case study reported here adopted the BPM Lifecycle reference framework to improve patient flows. In particular we focused on the process identification, discovery, and analysis phases of the BPM Lifecycle. Process-oriented data-mining techniques were applied to real practices to discover models of current patient flows in the ED of St. Andrew\u2019s War Memorial Hospital (SAWMH) in Queensland, Australia. The discovered models were used to evaluate the effect on patient flows of certain context factors of interest to stakeholders. Case histories of 1473 chest pain presentations at SAWMH between September 2011 and March 2013 were analyzed to determine process differences between ED patients with short stays (<4 h) and those with long stays (>4 h).   (c) Results achieved  Process models were discovered for the hospital\u2019s ED patient flow. From a control-flow perspective, only minor differences were observed between short- and long-stay patients at SAWMH, although there were timing differences in reaching specific milestone events. Waiting time in the ED following a request for hospital admission added significantly to overall ED LoS.   (d) Lessons learned  This project demonstrated that process mining is applicable to complex, semi-structured processes like those found in the healthcare domain. Comparative process performance analysis yielded some insights into ED patient flows, including recognition of recurring data-quality issues in datasets extracted from hospital information systems. The templated recognition and resolution of such issues offers a research opportunity to develop a (semi-)automated data-cleaning approach that would alleviate the tedious manual effort required to produce high-quality logs. The project highlighted the importance of hospital information systems collecting both start and end times of activities for proper performance analysis (duration, wait time, bottlenecks). Additions to our process-mining toolset include novel comparative process-performance visualization techniques that highlight the similarities and differences among process cohorts.","Date":"2018","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":null,"Pages":"311-333","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"Springer","Place":"Cham","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":"https:\/\/rd.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-58307-5_17","ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\RQFD4Z76\\Andrews et al. - 2018 - Improving Patient Flows at St. Andrew\u2019s War Memori.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Use Case; Klassifizierung; Relevant; Healthcare","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":"vom Brocke, Jan; Mendling, Jan","SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"SPG8FAFT","ItemType":"book","PublicationYear":2018.0,"Author":null,"Title":"Business Process Management Cases","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":"978-3-319-58307-5","ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"https:\/\/rd.springer.com\/book\/10.1007\/978-3-319-58307-5","AbstractNote":"The first book to present an extensive collection of real-world cases on Business Process Management Includes cases from world's leading organizations in various sectors Presents cases from a wide range of regions around the world (c) by Springer.com","Date":"2018","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":null,"Pages":null,"NumPages":"XVI, 610","Issue":null,"Volume":"10101","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":"Management for Professionals","SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"Springer","Place":"Cham","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\T6CSHY9P\\vom Brocke and Mendling - 2018 - Business Process Management Cases.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Use Case; Business Process Management","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":"vom Brocke, Jan; Mendling, Jan","SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"VPRTRFDE","ItemType":"document","PublicationYear":2020.0,"Author":null,"Title":"Process Mining at a Large European Insurance Company","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"https:\/\/apromore.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/A4-Apromore-CS-Claims-Handling-final-1.pdf","AbstractNote":"Claims handling is at the core of every insurance company.

Conceptually, we position process mining into the problem and solution space of process redesign and thereby offer a language to describe potentials and limitations of the technique.

Nowadays, companies struggle to build the required capabilities that lift process mining beyond technical proof-of-concept implementations. As research on process mining is largely limited to algorithm design and project management recommendations, current research does not understand well how process mining and complementary resources and capabilities can be aligned. By understanding those interrelations, companies learn to leverage their organizational potential during the execution of process mining more effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we address this research gap by using the design science research approach to develop a process mining alignment method. Our method supports companies mapping their individual technical requirements of process mining to their underlying organizational resources.

Most approaches assume that event data is accurately captured behavior. However, this is not realistic in many applications: data can contain uncertainty, generated from errors in recording, imprecise measurements, and other factors. Recently, new methods have been developed to analyze event data containing uncertainty; these techniques prominently rely on representing uncertain event data by means of graph-based models explicitly capturing uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to efficiently calculate a graph representation of the behavior contained in an uncertain process trace. We present our novel algorithm, prove its asymptotic time complexity, and show experimental results that highlight order-of-magnitude performance improvements for the behavior graph construction.

We propose an incremental procedure for building local process models capturing frequent patterns based on so-called process trees. We propose five quality dimensions and corresponding metrics for local process models, given an event log. We show monotonicity properties for some quality dimensions, enabling a speedup of local process model discovery through pruning.

they can be seen as the blueprints through which all data flows. These business processes leave tracks in information systems like Enterprise Resource Planning, Supply Chain Management and Workflow Management Systems. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are the most widely used ones; they control nearly anything that happens within a company. Most organizations keep records of various activities that have been carried out in these ERP systems for auditing purposes, but these are rarely used for analysis purposes and examined on a process level. From these recorded logs, valuable company information can be derived by looking for patterns in the tracks left behind. This technique is called process mining and focuses on discovering process models from event logs. The shift from data orientation to process orientation has demanded process mining solutions for ERP systems as well. Although many information systems produce logs, the information contained in these logs is not always suitable for process mining. A main step in performing process mining on such systems is therefore to properly construct an event log from the logged data. In this thesis we propose a method that guides in extracting event logs from SAP ECC 6.0. The research is performed at Futura Process Intelligence; a company that delivers products and services in the area of process intelligence and monitoring, especially in the context of process mining. In the method we can identify two phases: a first phase in which we prepare and configure a repository for each SAP process, and a second phase where we actually perform the event log extraction. Within this method we introduce the notion of table-case mappings. These represent the case in an event log and they are computed automatically based on foreign keys that exist between tables in SAP. Additionally, we have developed and implemented a method to incrementally update a previously extracted event log with only the changes from the SAP system that were registered since the original event log was created. Our solution entailed the development of a supporting prototype as well, which is applied as a proof of concept on some case studies of important SAP processes. The developed application prototype guides the event log extraction for the configured processes in our repository.

In SAP every transaction is stored and linked to relevant documents, organizational structures and other process-relevant information. However, the complexities and size of SAP logs make it hard to analyze the business processes directly with current process mining tools. This paper describes an ERP log analysis system that allows the users to define at a meta level how events, resources and their inter-relations are stored and transformed for use in process mining. We show how the system is applied to extract and transform related SAP transaction data for the ProM process mining tool.

The analyzed data often originates from process-unaware enterprise software, e.g. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. The differences in data management between ERP and process mining systems result in a large fraction of ambiguous cases, affected by convergence and divergence. The consequence is a chasm between the process as interpreted by process mining, and the process as executed in the ERP system. In this thesis, a purchasing process of an SAP ERP system is used to demonstrate, how ERP data can be extracted and transformed into a process mining event log that expresses ambiguous cases as accurately as possible. As the content and structure of the event log already define the scope (i.e. which process) and granularity (i.e. activity types), the process mining results depend on the event log quality. The results of this thesis show how the consideration of case attributes, the notion of a case and the granularity of events can be used to manage the event log quality. The proposed solution supports continuous event extraction from the ERP system.

The analysis of event data may reveal many performance and compliance problems, and generate ideas for performance improvements. This is valuable, however, process mining techniques tend to be backward-looking and provide little support for forward-looking approaches since potential process interventions are not assessed. System dynamics complements process mining since it aims to capture the relationships between different factors at a higher abstraction level, and uses simulation to predict the effects of process improvement actions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to support the design of system dynamics models using event data. We extract a variety of performance parameters from the current state of the process using historical execution data and provide an interactive platform for modeling the performance metrics as system dynamics models. The generated models are able to answer \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions. Our experiments, using event logs including different relationships between parameters, show that our approach is able to generate valid models and uncover the underlying relations.

We also extract the reported application studies and classify these by exploration domains or industry segments that are taking advantage of this technique. The applied research method was systematic mapping, which began with 3713 articles. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1278 articles were selected for review. In this article, an overview regarding process mining is presented, the main research topics are identified, followed by identification of the most applied process mining algorithms, and finally application domains among different business segments are reported on. It is possible to observe that the most active research topics are associated with the process discovery algorithms, followed by conformance checking, and architecture and tools improvements. In application domains, the segments with major case studies are healthcare followed by information and communication technology, manufacturing, education, finance, and logistics.

Using this data that contains information on the tacit knowledge of dispatchers can help to evaluate strategies for dealing with disruptions, which have not been subject to upfront planning. This paper proposes to use process mining methods, which are commonly applied in the context of business processes, to expose the hidden process of how the train traffic was actually dispatched. Different variants of dispatching are juxtaposed with the total delay in the railway system to visually explore the dispatching strategies taken. The technique has been implemented as a prototype and validated on a large dataset of real-life traffic in the Norwegian railway system.

Atomic components, be that web- or microservices, allow constructing flexible and loosely coupled systems. In such systems, services are building blocks orchestrated by business processes the system supports. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial software systems, implemented processes may deviate from those initially designed. In this paper, we propose a spectrum of conformance measurements. The spectrum results from a generalization of the recently introduced entropy-based approaches for measuring precision and recall between observed process executions and designed process models. The new generalized measures of precision and recall inherit the desired for this class of measures properties and provide analysts with flexible control over the sensitivity for identifying commonalities and discrepancies in the compared processes and performance of the techniques. The reported evaluation based on our implementation of the measures over real-world event logs and automatically discovered models confirms the feasibility of using the approach in industrial settings.

Analyzing event data, i.e., the focus of process mining, yields a detailed understanding of the process, e.g., we are able to discover the control flow of the process and detect compliance and performance issues. Most process mining techniques assume that the event data are of the same and\/or appropriate level of granularity. However, in practice, the data are extracted from different systems, e.g., systems for customer relationship management, Enterprise Resource Planning, etc., record the events at different granularity levels. Hence, pre-processing techniques that allow us to abstract event data into the right level of granularity are vital for the successful application of process mining. In this paper, we present a literature study, in which we assess the state-of-the-art in the application of such event abstraction techniques in the field of process mining. The survey is accompanied by a taxonomy of the existing approaches, which we exploit to highlight interesting novel directions.

While research in process mining predominantly focuses on the technical aspects, our work highlights organizational and managerial implications. Design\/methodology\/approach  We report on a focus group study conducted with process managers from various industries in Central Europe. This setting allowed us to gain diverse and in-depth insights about the needs and expectations of practitioners in relation to the adoption, use and management of process mining. Findings  We find that process managers face four central challenges. These challenges are largely related to four stages; (1) planning and business case calculation, (2) process selection, (3) implementation, and (4) process mining use. Research limitations\/implications We point to research opportunities in relation to the adoption, use and management of process mining. We suggest that future research should apply interdisciplinary study designs to better understand the managerial and organizational implications of process mining.  Practical implications  The reported challenges have various practical implications at the organizational and managerial level. We explore how existing BPM frameworks can be extended to meet these challenges. Originality\/value This study is among the first attempts to explore process mining from the perspective of process managers. It clarifies important challenges and points to avenues for future research.

Hence approaches for decreasing the effort of documentation while increasing its quality are required. This work introduces the idea of automatic task completion and documentation which is achieved through a process-aware solution where physical objects utilized during care tasks are equipped with NFC tags. Nine use cases from the care domain are identified with domain experts and implemented through a proof-of-concept prototype. The time reduction of employing this technology is assessed by domain experts within the typical routines in a nursing home. The interviews indicate an average decrease in documentation time per shift of more than 60%. Inherently also documentation quality is increased as automatic documentation prevents forgetting to document certain steps or other errors. On top, this work fosters two ways for comprehensive documentation, i.e., log-based documentation for analysis and monitoring tasks and paper-based documentation as typically expected by nurses. The logs are automatically created and stored by the underlying process engine. It is shown how paper-based documentation can be automatically created based on process logs. Overall, this work provides the basis for automatic, comprehensive, and continuous documentation of care tasks based on NFC technology.

One issue of interest to all data controllers, and of particular concern for researchers, is whether the GDPR expands the scope of personal data through the introduction of the term \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in Article 4(5). If all data which have been \u2018pseudonymised\u2019 in the conventional sense of the word (e.g. key-coded) are to be treated as personal data, this would have serious implications for research. Administrative data research, which is carried out on data routinely collected and held by public authorities, would be particularly affected as the sharing of de-identified data could constitute the unconsented disclosure of identifiable information. Instead, however, we argue that the definition of pseudonymisation in Article 4(5) GDPR will not expand the category of personal data, and that there is no intention that it should do so. The definition of pseudonymisation under the GDPR is not intended to determine whether data are personal data; indeed it is clear that all data falling within this definition are personal data. Rather, it is Recital 26 and its requirement of a \u2018means reasonably likely to be used\u2019 which remains the relevant test as to whether data are personal. This leaves open the possibility that data which have been \u2018pseudonymised\u2019 in the conventional sense of key-coding can still be rendered anonymous. There may also be circumstances in which data which have undergone pseudonymisation within one organisation could be anonymous for a third party. We explain how, with reference to the data environment factors as set out in the UK Anonymisation Network's Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework.

The delineation between personal data and non-personal data is of paramount importance to determine the GDPR\u2019s scope of application. This exercise is, however, fraught with difficulty, also when it comes to de-personalized data\u2014that is to say data that once was personal data but has been manipulated with the goal of turning it into anonymous data. This article charts that the legal definition of anonymous data is subject to uncertainty. Indeed, the definitions adopted in the GDPR, by the Article 29 Working Party and by national supervisory authorities diverge significantly. Whereas the GDPR admits that there can be a remaining risk of identification even in relation to anonymous data, others have insisted that no such risk is acceptable. After a review of the technical underpinnings of anonymization that is subsequently applied to two concrete case studies involving personal data used on blockchains, we conclude that there always remains a residual risk when anonymization is used. The concluding section links this conclusion to the more general notion of risk in the GDPR.

Oftentimes, such execution traces contain private information. For example, the execution traces of a healthcare process are likely to be privacy-sensitive. In such cases, organizations need to deploy Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to strike a balance between the benefits they get from analyzing these data and the requirements imposed onto them by privacy regulations, particularly that of minimizing re-identification risks when data are disclosed to a process analyst. Among many available PETs, differential privacy stands out for its ability to prevent predicate singling out attacks and its composable privacy guarantees. A drawback of differential privacy is the lack of interpretability of the main privacy parameter it relies upon, namely epsilon. This leads to the recurrent question of how much epsilon is enough? This article proposes a method to determine the epsilon value to be used when disclosing the output of a process mining technique in terms of two business-relevant metrics, namely absolute percentage error metrics capturing the loss of accuracy (a.k.a. utility loss) resulting from adding noise to the disclosed data, and guessing advantage, which captures the increase in the probability that an adversary may guess information about an individual as a result of a disclosure. The article specifically studies the problem of protecting the disclosure of the so-called Directly-Follows Graph (DFGs), which is a process mining artifact produced by most process mining tools. The article reports on an empirical evaluation of the utility-risk trade-offs that the proposed approach achieves on a collection of 13 real-life event logs.

Examples of clerical tasks include opening a file, selecting a field in a Web form or a cell in a spreadsheet, and copy-pasting data across fields or cells. Given that RPA can automate a wide range of routines, this raises the question of which routines should be automated in the first place. This paper presents a vision towards a family of techniques, termed robotic process mining (RPM), aimed at filling this gap. The core idea of RPM is that repetitive routines amenable for automation can be discovered from logs of interactions between workers and Web and desktop applications, also known as user interactions (UI) logs. The paper defines a set of basic concepts underpinning RPM and presents a pipeline of processing steps that would allow an RPM tool to generate RPA scripts from UI logs. The paper also discusses research challenges to realize the envisioned pipeline.

Mapping the end-to-end order processing is particularly important, as one needs to consider all order-fulfilling core processes to evaluate process performance. However, today's traditional process mapping methods such as workshops are subjective and time-consuming. Therefore, process improvements are based on gut feeling rather than facts, leading to high failure probabilities.

Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and typically there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we propose a technique for process mining. This technique uses workflow logs to discover the workflow process as it is actually being executed. The process mining technique proposed in this paper can deal with noise and can also be used to validate workflow processes by uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between prescriptive models and actual process executions.

These techniques provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded, thus, providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users. The goal is to increase the maturity of process mining as a new tool to improve the (re)design, control, and support of operational business processes. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Digital twin (DT), a virtual representation of a physical entity, serves this purpose. It aims to bridge the prevailing gap between the design and manufacturing stages of a product by effective flow of information. This article aims to create a state-of-the-art review on various DTs with their application areas. The article also includes schematic representations of some of the DTs proposed in various fields. The concept is also represented by a case study based on a DT model developed for an advanced manufacturing process named friction stir welding. Towards the end, a model for implementing DT in a factory has been proposed.

There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity\/Twin; Virtual Entity\/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection\/Twinning; Virtualto-Physical Connection\/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.  \u00a9 2020 University of Bristol.

Firms that have a strategy to optimise their performance in the supply chain (SC) are more prone to be successful. Most companies use data analytics for this purpose, and in order to continuously look for competitive advantage. One of the most important issues that organisations must deal with in SCM is inventory control. This thesis proposes the digital twin technology to solve this problem, by means of predictions made from historical data. This thesis conducted a series of simulation experiments to test the capacity of a digital twin simulation to be a better decision-maker than a classical model. The classical model chosen as a baseline was the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. The digital twin was designed with a reinforcement learning (RL) application based on a neural network (NN) and trained several times. Three different trials challenging the limitations of the baseline model were carried out. In order to overcome the EOQ model limitations, two delivery reliability indicators were created, thus allowing to generate different scenarios. Results showed that the inventory level and costs are affected in a different way depending on which reliability parameter is modified. The digital twin did not beat the EOQ model in any of the trials but an approach to it was achieved. Although the same number of iteration trainings were run in all the trials, the learning level reached was not the same. In two of the three trials, 30% of the experiments led to the same results as the classical model, whereas in the last one only 10% of the experiments reached them. This study is only a first approach to a big issue, the SCM. The digital twin can consider other external factors that classical models cannot. However, lots of resources that were not available in this project would be needed in order to properly model and simulate a real-world situation supply chain management, digital twin, neural network, reinforcement learning (C) by author(s) or publisher(s)","Date":"2019","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":"2020-11-20","Pages":null,"NumPages":"116","Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin","Place":"Berlin","Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":"Master","Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\BB4P5BWX\\Rodriguez Murciano - 2019 - What is the challenge in creating a process-based .pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Digital Twin; Business Process Management; Digital Process Twin; DPT Building Blocks; Logistics; Computer Science; Inventory Control","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"XL9E5ZXY","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2019.0,"Author":"Liu, Jinfeng; Zhou, Honggen; Tian, Guizhong; Liu, Xiaojun; Jing, Xuwen","Title":"Digital twin-based process reuse and evaluation approach for smart process planning","PublicationTitle":"The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":"10.1007\/s00170-018-2748-5","Url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00170-018-2748-5","AbstractNote":"(C) by author(s) or publisher(s)","Date":"2019-02","DateAdded":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","DateModified":"2023-09-29 14:25:35","AccessDate":null,"Pages":"1619-1634","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":"100","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":"Int J Adv Manuf Technol","ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\6ZM2G757\\Liu et al. - 2019 - Digital twin-based process reuse and evaluation ap.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Digital Twin; Process Mining; Business Process Management; Big Data","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"4UIJHWDQ","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2020.0,"Author":"Zhao, Peng; Liu, Jinfeng; Jing, Xuwen; Tang, Mingming; Sheng, Sushan; Zhou, Honggen; Liu, Xiaojun","Title":"The Modeling and Using Strategy for the Digital Twin in Process Planning","PublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2020.2974241","Url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/9003502\/","AbstractNote":"Process planning is the core of guiding process production and one of the most critical parts to realize intelligent manufacturing of products. In order to realize the monitoring, simulation, prediction and control of the physical space in the intelligent manufacturing mode, the digital twin technology is used to guide the process planning. This research describes a modeling method of digital twin process model (DTPM) for manufacturing process and the contents of DT data, discusses the acquisition method of real-time data and the management method of simulation data. Aiming at the data fusion between physical space and virtual space, a hierarchical model and mapping strategy for multi-source heterogeneous data in machining process are proposed to generate the DT data. Finally, the guidance and the visualization function in process planning of DTPM is analyzed, and the effectiveness of this method is verified by choosing the design process of a key component in a marine diesel engine.

This not only affects businesses, but also the entire society: smart homes, smart agriculture, and intelligent transportation. The connection of \u201cthings\u201d under the same umbrella applies also in education through massive open online courses (MOOCs). Each industry should adapt to the changes brought by Digital Era. This paper makes an introduction to the challenges that come together with Industry 4.0 and proposes Process Mining techniques as a new approach for business process analysis in order to support companies to rapidly adapt to market changes by offering customized solutions for customers. The study provides a brief overview of Industry 4.0 and gradually introduces Process Mining as a purview of Industry 4.0. A case study approach is used to confirm the advantages brought by Process Mining. Different types of graphical visualization describing both control-flow and resource perspectives are also presented.

Current trends show a shift away from the monolithic integrated product model towards a semantic product model. In order to extend this product model by a description of the manufacturing process, which is particularly important against the background of the digital twin, methods of process mining are suitable. The result of these methods is always a model of the given process, which is to be fed to the higher-level system via a semantic interface. Thus, ontologies that enable a semantic description are suitable for the interface definition. Within the scope of this article, based on an exemplary manufacturing process, process mining is applied and a prototypical interface is designed.

Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the \u201cplateau of productivity\u201d) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.

In this paper we review these published process mining case studies to assess the maturity of the field from a practice point of view by considering (i) diffusion of tools and techniques into practice, and (ii) the thoroughness of the application of process mining methodologies. Diffusion is assessed by analysing the breadth of domains to which process mining has been applied and the variety of tools and techniques employed. We define measures of thoroughness for each of the various phases of a generalised process mining methodology and examine case studies identified from a literature search against these measures. We conclude that, despite maturing in terms of diffusion, application of process mining in practice has not seen an increased maturity over time in terms of thoroughness. One way to redress this situation is to pay more attention to the development of and adherence to methodological guidance.

In this book the authors provide an answer to this question by presenting a healthcare reference model that outlines all the different classes of data that are potentially available for process mining in healthcare and the relationships between them. Subsequently, based on this reference model, they explain the application opportunities for process mining in this domain and discuss the various kinds of analyses that can be performed. They focus on organizational healthcare processes rather than medical treatment processes. The combination of event data and process mining techniques allows them to analyze the operational processes within a hospital based on facts, thus providing a solid basis for managing and improving processes within hospitals. To this end, they also explicitly elaborate on data quality issues that are relevant for the data aspects of the healthcare reference model. This book mainly targets advanced professionals involved in areas related to business process management, business intelligence, data mining, and business process redesign for healthcare systems as well as graduate students specializing in healthcare information systems and process analysis.

Despite the omnipresence of such data, most organizations diagnose problems based on fiction rather than facts. Process mining is an emerging discipline based on process model-driven approaches and data mining. It not only allows organizations to fully benefit from the information stored in their systems, but it can also be used to check the conformance of processes, detect bottlenecks, and predict execution problems. Wil van der Aalst delivers the first book on process mining. It aims to be self-contained while covering the entire process mining spectrum from process discovery to operational support. In Part I, the author provides the basics of business process modeling and data mining necessary to understand the remainder of the book. Part II focuses on process discovery as the most important process mining task. Part III moves beyond discovering the control flow of processes and highlights conformance checking, and organizational and time perspectives. Part IV guides the reader in successfully applying process mining in practice, including an introduction to the widely used open-source tool ProM. Finally, Part V takes a step back, reflecting on the material presented and the key open challenges. Overall, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in process mining. It is intended for business process analysts, business consultants, process managers, graduate students, and BPM researchers.

The conscious treatment of business processes as significant corporate assets has facilitated substantial improvements in organizational performance but is also used to ensure the conformance of corporate activities. This Handbook presents in two volumes the contemporary body of knowledge as articulated by the world' s leading BPM thought leaders. This first volume focuses on arriving at a sound definition of BPM approaches and examines BPM methods and process-aware information systems. As such, it provides guidance for the integration of BPM into corporate methodologies and information systems. Each chapter has been contributed by leading international experts. Selected case studies complement their views and lead to a summary of BPM expertise that is unique in its coverage of the most critical success factors of BPM. The second edition of this handbook has been significantly revised and extended. Each chapter has been updated to reflect the most current developments. This includes in particular new technologies such as in-memory data and process management, social media and networks. A further focus of this revised and extended edition is on the actual deployment of the proposed theoretical concepts. This volume includes a number of entire new chapters from some of the world's leading experts in the domain of BPM.

BI is now impacted by the \u201cBig Data\u201d phenomena and the evolution of society and users. In particular, BI applications must cope with additional heterogeneous (often Web-based) sources, e.g., from social networks, blogs, competitors\u2019, suppliers\u2019, or distributors\u2019 data, governmental or NGO-based analysis and papers, or from research publications. In addition, they must be able to provide their results also on mobile devices, taking into account location-based or time-based environmental data. The lectures held at the Third European Business Intelligence Summer School (eBISS), which are presented here in an extended and refined format, cover not only established BI and BPM technologies, but extend into innovative aspects that are important in this new environment and for novel applications, e.g., pattern and process mining, business semantics, Linked Open Data, and large-scale data management and analysis. Combining papers by leading researchers in the field, this volume equips the reader with the state-of-the-art background necessary for creating the future of BI. It also provides the reader with an excellent basis and many pointers for further research in this growing field.

This volume contains 21 contributed research papers that were selected from 151 submissions. The thorough reviewing process (each paper was reviewed by three to solve Program Committee members followed in most cases by in-depth discussions) was extremely competitive with an acceptance rate of 14%. In addition to the contributed papers, these proceedings contain three short papers about the invited keynote talks. In conjunction with the main conference, nine international workshops took place the day before the conference. These workshops fostered the exchange of fresh ideas and experiences between active BPM researchers, and stimulated discussions on new and emerging issues in line with the conference topics. The proceedings with the papers of all workshops will be published in a separate volume of Springer\u2019s Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing series. Beyond that, the conference also included a doctoral consortium, an industry program, ?reside chats, tutorials, panels, and demonstrations.

That's why data collection and analysis is so in-demand in this field. But the main task is not to collect as much information as possible, but to extract from it what will help optimize business processes. Deep process analysis (Process mining) allows organizations to investigate and improve their business processes and helps them to perform their activities more effectively and economically. At the seminar, you will learn about the details of using this method from one of the leading experts in this field, Wil van der Aalst.

Berechnung der Schnittkr\u00e4fte auf Basis von Prozessdaten bei einer Fr\u00e4sbearbeitung ist eine wesentliche Systemkomponente zur Erstellung eines digitalen Prozesszwillings \/H\u00c4N-18\/. Ziel dieser Systemkomponente ist es, dass nicht mit aufwendiger Messtechnik, wie bspw. mit einem 3-Komponenten Dynamometer, die Kr\u00e4fte direkt gemessen werden, sondern das mit den zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Prozessdaten aus der NC-Steuerung die wirkenden Schnittkr\u00e4fte ermittelt werden k\u00f6nnen. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf der Aufzeichnung von Antriebsstr\u00f6men und der diskreten Berechnung der geometrischen Eingriffsgr\u00f6\u00dfen bei der Fr\u00e4sbearbeitung. Nach dem Prinzip eines \u201eSoftsensors\u201c ist daf\u00fcr eine Abh\u00e4ngigkeitssimulation zwischen Antriebsstrom und wirkenden Schnittkr\u00e4ften zu erstellen. Des Weiteren muss mit Hilfe einer Abtragssimulation das Spanungsvolumen und weiterf\u00fchrend, mit Hilfe der geometrischen Informationen des Werkzeuges, die mittlere Spanungsdicke ermittelt werden. Nachfolgend ist eine Methode zur Berechnung der Schnittkr\u00e4fte unter Verwendung einer 3-Achs Fr\u00e4smaschine mit einer HEIDENHAIN TNC620 Steuerung beschrieben.

Mit Prozess-Mining k\u00f6nnen unter anderem Prozessmodelle automatisch generiert und Leistungsmetriken erzeugt werden. Die Zusammenarbeit von Menschen in einem Prozess kann veranschaulicht werden, um herauszufinden, wie gut diese zusammenarbeiten und wie die Leistung individuell ist. Die Konformit\u00e4t von Ereignisdaten und Prozessmodellen kann \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden, um herauszufinden ob Vorgaben eingehalten wurden, oder in welcher Instanz dies nicht getan wurde.

Starting off in the early 2000\u2019s, with limited to no tool support, nowadays, several software tools, i.e., both open-source, e.g., ProM and Apromore, and commercial, e.g., Disco, Celonis, ProcessGold, etc., exist. The commercial process mining tools provide limited support for implementing custom algorithms. Moreover, both commercial and open-source process mining tools are often only accessible through a graphical user interface, which hampers their usage in large-scale experimental settings. Initiatives such as RapidProM provide process mining support in the scientific workflow-based data science suite RapidMiner. However, these offer limited to no support for algorithmic customization. In the light of the aforementioned, in this paper, we present a novel process mining library, i.e., Process Mining for Python (PM4Py), that aims to bridge this gap, providing integration with state-of-the-art data science libraries, e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy and scikit-learn. We provide a global overview of the architecture and functionality of PM4Py, accompanied by some representative examples of its usage.

Aiming at a better process understanding and improvement, this event data can be used to analyze processes using process mining techniques. Process models can be automatically discovered and the execution can be checked for conformance to specified behavior. Moreover, existing process models can be enhanced and annotated with valuable information, for example for performance analysis. While the maturity of process mining algorithms is increasing and more tools are entering the market, process mining projects still face the problem of different levels of abstraction when comparing events with modeled business activities. Mapping the recorded events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process discovery results.

On the one hand, conventional Business Process Management (BPM) and Workflow Management (WfM) approaches and tools are mostly model-driven with little consideration for event data. On the other hand, Data Mining (DM), Business Intelligence (BI), and Machine Learning (ML) focus on data without considering end-to-end process models. Process mining aims to bridge the gap between BPM and WfM on the one hand and DM, BI, and ML on the other hand. Here, the challenge is to turn torrents of event data (\u201cBig Data\u201d) into valuable insights related to process performance and compliance. Fortunately, process mining results can be used to identify and understand bottlenecks, inefficiencies, deviations, and risks. This tutorial paper introduces basic process mining techniques that can be used for process discovery and conformance checking. Moreover, some very general decomposition results are discussed. These allow for the decomposition and distribution of process discovery and conformance checking problems, thus enabling process mining in the large.

Conformance checking techniques allow us to assess to what degree such process models and corresponding process execution data correspond to one another. In recent years, alignments have proven extremely useful for calculating conformance checking statistics. Existing techniques to compute alignments have been developed to be used in an offline, a posteriori setting. However, we are often interested in observing deviations at the moment they occur, rather than days, weeks or even months later. Hence, we need techniques that enable us to perform conformance checking in an online setting. In this paper, we present a novel approach to incrementally compute prefix-alignments, paving the way for real-time online conformance checking. Our experiments show that the reuse of previously computed prefix-alignments enhances memory efficiency, whilst preserving prefix-alignment optimality. Moreover, we show that, in case of computing approximate prefix-alignments, there is a clear trade-off between memory efficiency and approximation error.

This allows a comparison between the intended behavior represented by the model and the actual behavior captured by the log and is useful for many applications such as auditing. Existing approaches calculate conformance as follows: each deviation between model and log is corrected by an alignment, e.g., inserting a missing event to the log, that has a standard per-deviation cost of 1. While deviations in the model can be handled this way, there is no way to differentiate between intended (e.g., ad-hoc repair of instances) and unintended (e.g., security breaches) deviations. Hence this work proposes an advanced cost function, that allows for per-deviation adjustments of the per-deviation costs. By inspecting how the data elements of subsequent tasks are affected, it becomes possible to automatically increase or decrease the per-deviation costs of 1, thus allowing for an automatic classification of deviation causes. The proposed approach works offline and online (i.e., at runtime) and is evaluated based on a real-world dataset from the manufacturing domain.

However, logs potentially contain sensitive information about individual employees involved in process execution that are only partially hidden by an obfuscation of the event data. In this paper, we therefore address the risk of privacy-disclosure attacks on event logs with pseudonymized employee information. To this end, we introduce PRETSA, a novel algorithm for event log sanitization that provides privacy guarantees in terms of k-anonymity and t-closeness. It thereby avoids disclosure of employee identities, their membership in the event log, and their characterization based on sensitive attributes, such as performance information. Through step-wise transformations of a prefix-tree representation of an event log, we maintain its high utility for discovery of a performance-annotated process model. Experiments with real-world data demonstrate that sanitization with PRETSA yields event logs of higher utility compared to methods that exploit frequency-based filtering, while providing the same privacy guarantees.

A regular analysis and optimization of these processes is beneficial for companies to increase quality, reduce costs, and identify process risks. Process mining techniques provide insights into the common flows of activities, detect deviations and compliance issues, and report process performance. In this paper, we present the analysis and evaluation of procurement processes of a company in the area of coatings and paints from the Netherlands. Applying filtering and discovering techniques, the paper presents six process models for handling different types of purchase orders. In addition, deviations of these flows and compliance violations, their frequencies, and root causes are described. Finally, key performance indicators regarding throughput time are defined and measured.

Process mining offers both methodologies and tools to get unique insights into the process data. The process discovery, visualization, and conformance checking provide support not only for the management or process owners but also for all process users. On the other hand, most companies already possess different tools and paramount knowledge on how to analyze and understand data in their specific domain. In our approach, we try to find synergies between the classic data and process mining to let the users with tools and domain knowledge to deploy it in their daily tasks. In the following paper, we will demonstrate the framework for combining Process Mining Techniques with Data Science and BI Tools to achieve the best data insights for the given context and to utilize existing investment in knowledge and software in the organization.

Process mining provides a fact-based understanding of actual processes in the form of discovered process diagrams, bottlenecks, compliance issues, and other operational problems. Organizations need to carry out accurate root cause analysis and efficient resource allocation to improve the process and reduce problems.   This work presents a novel influence analysis method to improve the allocation of development resources, detect process changes, and discover business areas that significantly affect process flow. The method combines the usage of process mining analysis with probability-based objective measures and analysis of deviations. The method is specially designed for business analysts, process owners, line managers, and auditors in large organizations, to be used as a set of interactive root cause analyses and benchmark reports. Methods and algorithms are presented for analyzing both binary problems where each case is either successful or non-successful, and continuous variables, including process lead times and costs. A method for using case-specific weights to consider the relative business importance of each case is also presented. This work also includes data preparation methods and best practices for acquiring relevant business operations data in the event log format.   Concept drift in process mining is a research area that studies business process changes over time. This dissertation shows how process mining can be used to identify changes in business operations by using the influence analysis method to identify business process changes in the business review context. Typical business reviews consist of monitoring key performance indicator (KPI) measures against targets, while the detection of activity level process changes is often based on subjective manual observations alone. Many relevant changes are not detected promptly, making organizations slow to adapt to changes.   Machine learning techniques such as clustering extend the coverage of process mining analyses. A method for clustering cases based on process flow characteristics and using influence analysis to explain the results with business attributes is presented. The method identifies business areas where the process execution differs significantly from the rest of the organization.   Finally, the results of using our methods with publicly available industrial datasets, including service desk data from Rabobank, loan applications process data from a Dutch Financial Institute, and publicly available purchase to pay process data are presented.

A key road block to this vision is the lack of transparency surrounding the quality of data. A process mining study that utilises low-quality, unrepresentative data as input has little or no value for the organisation and becomes a catalyst for erroneous conclusions (Garbage-in-Garbage-out). Many process mining techniques do not take into account inherent inaccuracies in the data, or how the data might have been manipulated or pre-processed. It is thus impossible to ascertain the degree to which analysis outcomes can be relied upon. This tutorial paper outlines foundational concepts of data quality with a special focus on typical data quality issues found in event data used for process mining analyses. Key challenges and possible approaches to tackle these data quality problems are elaborated on.

Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify and address performance and compliance problems. In recent years, the adoption of process mining in practice increased rapidly. It is interesting to see how ideas first developed in open-source tools like ProM, get transferred to the dozens of available commercial process mining tools. However, these tools still resort to producing Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) based on event data rather than using more sophisticated notations also able to capture concurrency. Moreover, to tackle complexity, DFGs are seamlessly simplified by removing nodes and edges based on frequency thresholds. Process-mining practitioners tend to use such simplified DFGs actively. Despite their simplicity, these DFGs may be misleading and users need to know how these process models are generated before interpreting them. In this paper, we discuss the pitfalls of using simple DFGs generated by commercial tools.

The Blockchain Forum and the RPA Forum have in common that they are centered around an emerging and exciting technology. The blockchain is a sophisticated distributed ledger technology, while RPA software allows for mimicking human, repetitive actions. Each of these have the potential to fundamentally change how business processes are being orchestrated and executed in practice.

A process tree is a (mathematical) tree-based model of a process, in which internal vertices represent behavioral control-flow relations and leaves represent process activities. Translation of a process tree into a sound workflow net is trivial. However, the reverse is not the case. Simultaneously, an algorithm that translates a WF-net into a process tree is of great interest, e.g., the explicit knowledge of the control-flow hierarchy in a WF-net allows one to reason on its behavior more easily. Hence, in this paper, we present such an algorithm, i.e., it detects whether a WF-net corresponds to a process tree, and, if so, constructs it. We prove that, if the algorithm finds a process tree, the language of the process tree is equal to the language of the original WF-net. The experiments conducted show that the algorithm\u2019s corresponding implementation has a quadratic time complexity in the size of the WF-net. Furthermore, the experiments show strong evidence of process tree rediscoverability.

However, RPA is limited in scope and, in order for it to be established successfully, its environment must meet many requirements. The more mature research field of business process management (BPM) has the potential to provide the environment for RPA to thrive. We present an approach for embedding RPA into BPM in order to link their technologies and combine their systematic methods. The approach allows RPA to synergize with capabilities and insights provided by BPM.

This wealth of information can be aggregated and get visualized with several ways, to result in alluring illustrations. However, existing aggregation techniques tend to consider that events are fragmentary, or that they are part of a strictly sequential chain. Nevertheless, events\u2019 occurrences may appear with varying structures (i.e., others than sequence), reflecting elements of a larger, implicit process. In this work, we propose a methodology that will support analysts to get richer insights from event datasets by enabling a process perspective.

We furthermore discuss the methodological and epistemological aspects that are needed to make our approach applicable for event analytics.

One of the most widely studied process mining operations is automated process discovery. An automated process discovery method takes as input an event log, and produces as output a business process model that captures the control-flow relations between tasks that are observed in or implied by the event log. Various automated process discovery methods have been proposed in the past two decades, striking different tradeoffs between scalability, accuracy and complexity of the resulting models. However, these methods have been evaluated in an ad-hoc manner, employing different datasets, experimental setups, evaluation measures and baselines, often leading to incomparable conclusions and sometimes unreproducible results due to the use of closed datasets. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of automated process discovery methods, using an open-source benchmark and covering twelve publicly-available real-life event logs, twelve proprietary real-life event logs, and nine quality metrics. The results highlight gaps and unexplored tradeoffs in the field, including the lack of scalability of some methods and a strong divergence in their performance with respect to the different quality metrics used.

Eine Variante, mit der die Prozessverbesserung \u00fcber Industrie 4.0 Anwendungen ablaufen kann, ist mit dem Einsatz von Process Mining Software. Bei Process-Mining handelt es sich um ein Themenfeld, das in den letzten Jahren sowohl im Bereich der Forschung als auch f\u00fcr die Anwendung im Unternehmen immer wichtiger geworden ist. Infolgedessen haben es sich viele Softwarehersteller zur Aufgabe gemacht, ihren Kunden mithilfe von Process-Mining-Software eine \u00fcbersichtliche Darstellung von Prozessabl\u00e4ufen zu erm\u00f6glichen, damit diese Verbesserungen an einzelnen Prozessen im Unternehmen durchf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Die Verbesserungen, die dabei durchgef\u00fchrt werden, sollen verhindern, dass Aktivit\u00e4ten oder Ressourcen unn\u00f6tig ausgelastet oder dass Prozessabl\u00e4ufe unn\u00f6tige Wiederholungen von Aktivit\u00e4ten enthalten. Die Softwarehersteller setzen dabei unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte bei der Entwicklung ihrer Werkzeuge. Um f\u00fcr ausgew\u00e4hlte Werkzeuge die Eignung f\u00fcr bestimmte Aufgaben im Process Mining festzustellen, wurden die Werkzeuge mithilfe allgemeiner Softwareanforderungen sowie mit unterschiedlichen Testdaten anhand von eigens daf\u00fcr erstellten Frageb\u00f6gen getestet. Die Ergebnisse wurden miteinander verglichen, um damit R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse zu ziehen, f\u00fcr welche Aufgaben des Process-Minings sich welche Werkzeuge am besten eignen. Die Analyse zeigt, dass einige Werkzeuge besser f\u00fcr die Case-Identifikation, andere Werkzeuge besser f\u00fcr das Social Mining und wieder andere besser f\u00fcr die Bottleneck-Analyse geeignet sind. Des Weiteren hat sich herausgestellt, dass es Werkzeuge gibt mit denen mehr Aufgaben als allgemein in den Anforderungen formuliert wurde. Diese Arbeit stellt eine Handlungsempfehlung dar, wie nach geeigneter Process Mining Software recherchiert und je nach Use Case eine geeignete Software ausgew\u00e4hlt werden kann.

While benefits of process mining are widely acknowledged, many people rightfully have concerns about irresponsible use of personal data. Healthcare information systems contain highly sensitive information and healthcare regulations often require protection of privacy of such data. The need to comply with strict privacy requirements may result in a decreased data utility for analysis. Although, until recently, data privacy issues did not get much attention in the process mining community, several privacy-preserving data transformation techniques have been proposed in the data mining community. Many similarities between data mining and process mining exist, but there are key differences that make privacy-preserving data mining techniques unsuitable to anonymise process data. In this article, we analyse data privacy and utility requirements for healthcare process data and assess the suitability of privacy-preserving data transformation methods to anonymise healthcare data. We also propose a framework for privacy-preserving process mining that can support healthcare process mining analyses.

Process mining provides a welcome extension of the repertoire of business process analysis techniques and has been adopted in various commercial BPM systems (BPM\/one, Futura Reflect, ARIS PPM, Fujitsu, etc.). Unfortunately, traditional process discovery algorithms have problems dealing with less-structured processes. The resulting models are difficult to comprehend or even misleading. Therefore, we propose a new approach based on trace alignment. The goal is to align traces in a way that event logs can be explored easily. Trace alignment can be used in a preprocessing phase where the event log is investigated or filtered and in later phases where detailed questions need to be answered. Hence, it complements existing process mining techniques focusing on discovery and conformance checking. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

However, they largely neglect the important aspect of time, a crucial part of process and choreography models manifested in deadlines, delays, and other temporal constraints. We argue that this deficit is due to inherent limitations of smart contracts---in particular the absence of a natural notion of measuring time---on popular blockchain platforms used in research and practice. We introduce a set of time measures available on blockchain platforms to alleviate these issues, and systematically compare their properties. We also give hints as to their suitability for facilitating various temporal constraints commonly found in process models.

Service orientation can be used to decompose complex systems into loosely coupled software components that may run remotely. However, the distributed nature of services complicates the design and analysis of service-oriented systems that support end-to-end business processes. Fortunately, services leave trails in so-called event logs and recent breakthroughs in process mining research make it possible to discover, analyze, and improve business processes based on such logs. Recently, the task force on process mining released the process mining manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active participation from end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrate the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. In this paper, we focus on the opportunities and challenges for service mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to services. We discuss the guiding principles and challenges listed in the process mining manifesto and also highlight challenges specific for service-orientated systems. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.

Event logs have a very particular structure; events have timestamps, refer to activities and resources, and need to be correlated to form process instances. Process mining results tend to be very different from classical data mining results, e.g., process discovery may yield end-to-end process models capturing different perspectives rather than decision trees or frequent patterns. A process-mining tool like ProM provides hundreds of different process mining techniques ranging from discovery and conformance checking to filtering and prediction. Typically, a combination of techniques is needed and, for every step, there are different techniques that may be very sensitive to parameter settings. Moreover, event logs may be huge and may need to be decomposed and distributed for analysis. These aspects make it very cumbersome to analyze event logs manually. Process mining should be repeatable and automated. Therefore, we propose a framework to support the analysis of process mining workflows. Existing scientific workflow systems and data mining tools are not tailored towards process mining and the artifacts used for analysis (process models and event logs). This paper structures the basic building blocks needed for process mining and describes various analysis scenarios. Based on these requirements we implemented RapidProM, a tool supporting scientific workflows for process mining. Examples illustrating the different scenarios are provided to show the feasibility of the approach.

It is not uncommon for large organizations to have to manage thousands of process models. Retrieval of process models with desired properties then poses a significant challenge, particularly when one is concerned with finding models that describe certain process scenarios, i.e., sequences of tasks captured in models. This paper proposes a method for automated process model retrieval based on scenario compatibility. A process model is retrieved if it has the potential to perform the specified process scenario. To allow for scenarios to be underspecified, wildcards may be used in their description. The paper reports on a formal language for scenario-based process querying, its implementation, and evaluation in the context of industrial and synthetic process models. The results show that the technique works in (close to) real time.

Discovering a process model from such event data and verification of the quality of discovered models are important steps in process mining. Many discovery techniques have been proposed, but none of them combines scalability with strong quality guarantees. We would like such techniques to handle billions of events or thousands of activities, to produce sound models (without deadlocks and other anomalies), and to guarantee that the underlying process can be rediscovered when sufficient information is available. In this paper, we introduce a framework for process discovery that ensures these properties while passing over the log only once and introduce three algorithms using the framework. To measure the quality of discovered models for such large logs, we introduce a model\u2013model and model\u2013log comparison framework that applies a divide-and-conquer strategy to measure recall, fitness, and precision. We experimentally show that these discovery and measuring techniques sacrifice little compared to other algorithms, while gaining the ability to cope with event logs of 100,000,000 traces and processes of 10,000 activities on a standard computer.

The essential means enabling an organisation to achieve goals are business processes. Properly managed, business processes are a source of revenue and become an implementation of business strategy. The critical elements in process management in an enterprise are process monitoring and control. It is therefore essential to identify the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to the analysed processes. Process monitoring can be performed at various levels of management, as well as from different perspectives: operational, financial, security, or maintenance. Some of the indicators known from other fields (such as personnel management, finance, or lean manufacturing) can be used in mining. However, the operational mining processes require a definition of specific indicators, especially in the context of increasing the productivity of mining machines and the possibility of using sensor data from machines and devices. The article presents a list of efficiency indicators adjusted to the specifics and particular needs of the mining industry resulting from the Industry 4.0 concept, as well as sustainable business performance. Using the conducted research and analysis, a list of indicators has been developed concerning person groups, which may serve as a benchmark for mining industry entities. The presented proposal is a result of work conducted in the SmartHUB project, which aims to create an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform that will support process management in the mining industry.

These techniques are driven by observed events rather than hand-made models. Event logs are used to learn and enrich process models. By replaying history using the model, it is possible to establish a precise relationship between events and model elements. This relationship can be used to check conformance and to analyze performance. For example, it is possible to diagnose deviations from the modeled behavior. The severity of each deviation can be quantified. Moreover, the relationship established during replay and the timestamps in the event log can be combined to show bottlenecks. These examples illustrate the importance of maintaining a proper alignment between event log and process model. Therefore, we elaborate on the realization of such alignments and their application to conformance checking and performance analysis. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Python gilt aktuell als eine der beliebtesten Einsteigersprachen \u00fcberhaupt, denn Python wurde mit dem Ziel gr\u00f6\u00dfter Einfachheit und \u00dcbersichtlichkeit entworfen. Zentrales Ziel bei der Entwicklung der Sprache war die F\u00f6rderung eines gut lesbaren, knappen Program- mierstils. In vielen L\u00e4ndern hat Python an Universit\u00e4ten bei Anf\u00e4ngerkursen in informa- tikbezogenen Studieng\u00e4ngen Java abgel\u00f6st, was \u00fcber viele Jahre die Szene beherrscht hatte und im professionellen Umfeld immer noch das Ma\u00df aller Dinge darstellt. Wobei man erw\u00e4hnen muss, dass viele neue Python-Programmierer dann sp\u00e4ter zus\u00e4tzlich Java oder eine andere OO-Sprache wie C# lernen oder auch darauf umsteigen. Aber auch f\u00fcr diesen Weg legt Python mit dem Zwang zu einem strukturierten, klaren Programmierstil eine hervorragende Grundlage \u2013 wenn man dessen Freiheiten nicht missbraucht. Umgekehrt l\u00e4sst sich Python sehr schnell erfassen, wenn man bereits Erfahrung mit anderen, weitgehend beliebigen Programmiersprachen hat. Denn Python unterst\u00fctzt sowohl die objektorientierte, die aspektorientierte, die strukturierte als auch die funktio- nale Programmierung. Das bedeutet, Python zwingt den Programmierer nicht zu einem einzigen Programmierstil, sondern erlaubt, das f\u00fcr die jeweilige Aufgabe am besten geeignete Paradigma zu w\u00e4hlen. Und damit k\u00f6nnen ebenso Erfahrungen aus anderen Programmierkonzepten mehr oder weniger direkt weitergenutzt werden. Dieser univer- sell m\u00f6gliche Zugang ist neben der Einfachheit vermutlich eines der Erfolgsrezepte von Python. Nun noch kurz zu meiner Person. Ich habe vor vielen Jahren in Frankfurt\/Main an der Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Mathematik studiert (Diplom) und danach anfangs einen recht typischen Werdegang f\u00fcr Mathematiker genommen: Ich bin bei einer gro\u00dfen Versicherung gelandet \u2013 aber schon da mit IT-Schwerpunkt. Zuerst habe ich einige Jahre als Program- mierer mit Turbo Pascal und sp\u00e4ter mit C und C++ gearbeitet. Nach vier Jahren habe ich in die fachliche Konzeption f\u00fcr eine Gro\u00dfrechnerdatenbank unter MVS gewechselt. Die Erfahrung war f\u00fcr meinen Schritt in die Selbst\u00e4ndigkeit sehr motivationsf\u00f6rdernd, denn mir wurde klar, dass ich das nicht auf Dauer machen wollte. Seit 1996 verdiene ich daher meinen Lebensunterhalt als Freelancer, wobei ich fliegend zwischen der Arbeit als Fach- autor, Fachjournalist, EDV-Dozent, Consultant und Programmierer wechsele. Daneben referiere ich gelegentlich auf Web-Kongressen, unterrichte an verschiedenen Akademien und Fachhochschulen oder nehme Videotrainings auf. Das macht aus meiner Sicht einen guten Mix aus, bewahrt vor beruflicher Langeweile und h\u00e4lt mich in der Praxis als auch am Puls der Entwicklung. Insbesondere habe ich das Vergn\u00fcgen als auch die Last, mich per- manent \u00fcber neue Entwicklungen auf dem Laufenden zu halten, denn die Halbwertszeit von Computerwissen ist ziemlich kurz. Dementsprechend ist mein Job zwar anstrengend, aber vor allem immer wieder spannend. Wenn Sie weitere und detaillierte Informationen zu meiner Person erhalten wollen, finden Sie mich nat\u00fcrlich im Internet. Ich bin in diver- sen sozialen Netzwerken und nat\u00fcrlich auch mit einer eigenen Webseite im weltweiten Web unterwegs. Etwa hier: http:\/\/www.rjs.de http:\/\/blog.rjs.de. Doch lassen Sie uns also jetzt mit Python beginnen.

In the medical education field, instructors who teach surgical procedures need to understand how their students are learning to give them feedback and assess them objectively. The sequence of steps of surgical procedures is an aspect rarely considered in medical education, and state-of-the-art tools for giving feedback and assessing students do not focus on this perspective. Process Mining can help to include this perspective in this field since it has recently been used successfully in some applications. However, these previous developments are more centred on students than on instructors. This paper presents the use of Process Mining to fill this gap, generating a taxonomy of activities and a process-oriented instrument. We evaluated both tools with instructors who teach central venous catheter insertion. The results show that the instructors found both tools useful to provide objective feedback and objective assessment. We concluded that the instructors understood the information provided by the instrument since it provides helpful information to understand students\u2019 performance regarding the sequence of steps followed.

To improve the effectiveness of the training, it is advisable to provide feedback to each student tailored to how the student has performed the procedure on each occasion. Current state-of-the-art feedback is based on Checklists and Global Rating Scales, which indicate whether all process steps have been carried out and the quality of each execution step. However, there is a process perspective that is not captured successfully by these instruments, e.g., steps performed, but in an undesired order, group of activities that are repeated an unnecessary number of times, or an excessive transition time between two consecutive steps. In this research, we propose a novel use of process mining techniques to effectively identify desired and undesired process patterns regarding rework, the order in which activities are performed, and time performance, in order to complement the tailored feedback for surgical procedures using a process perspective. The proposed approach was applied to analyze a real case of ultrasound-guided Central Venous Catheter placement training. It was quantitatively and qualitatively validated that the students who participated in the training program perceived the process-oriented feedback they received as favorable for their learning.

There is a need to develop approaches for modeling, analysis, improvement and monitoring processes within PAIS. These approaches include process mining techniques used to discover process models from event logs, find log and model deviations, and analyze performance characteristics of processes. The representational bias (a way to model processes) plays an important role in process mining. The BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) standard is widely used and allows to build conventional and understandable process models. In addition to the flat control flow perspective, subprocesses, data flows, resources can be integrated within one BPMN diagram. This makes BPMN very attractive for both process miners and business users, since the control flow perspective can be integrated with data and resource perspectives discovered from event logs. In this paper, we describe and justify robust control flow conversion algorithms, which provide the basis for more advanced BPMN-based discovery and conformance checking algorithms. Thus, on the basis of these conversion algorithms low-level models (such as Petri nets, causal nets and process trees) discovered from event logs using existing approaches can be represented in terms of BPMN. Moreover, we establish behavioral relations between Petri nets and BPMN models and use them to adopt existing conformance checking and performance analysis techniques in order to visualize conformance and performance information within a BPMN diagram. We believe that the results presented in this paper can be used for a wide variety of BPMN mining and conformance checking algorithms. We also provide metrics for the processes discovered before and after the conversion to BPMN structures. Cases for which conversion algorithms produce more compact or more complicated BPMN models in comparison with the initial models are identified.

These techniques provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded, thus, providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users. The goal is to increase the maturity of process mining as a new tool to improve the (re)design, control, and support of operational business processes. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Data mining techniques have been widely used to extract knowledge from such data, e.g., community detection and sentiment analysis. However, there is still much space to explore in terms of the event data (i.e., events with timestamps), such as posting a question, commenting on a tweet, and editing a Wikipedia article. These events reflect users' behavior patterns and operational processes in the media sites. Classical process mining techniques support to discover insights from event data generated by structured business processes. However, they fail to deal with the social media data which are from more flexible \u201cmedia\u201d processes and contain one-to-many and many-to-many relations. This paper employs a novel type of process mining techniques (based on object-centric behavioral constraint models) to derive insights from the event data in social media. Based on real-life data, process models are mined to describe users' behavior patterns. Conformance and performance are analyzed to detect the deviations and bottlenecks in the question and answer process in the Stack Exchange website.

The area of process mining deals with extracting knowledge from this data. Real-life processes can be effectively discovered, analyzed and optimized with the help of mature process mining techniques. There is a variety of process mining case studies and experience reports from such business areas as healthcare, public, transportation and education. Although nowadays, these techniques are mostly used for discovering business processes.The goal of this industrial paper is to show that process mining can be applied to software too. Here we present and analyze our experiences on applying process mining in different productive software systems used in the touristic domain. Process models and user interface workflows underlie the functional specifications of the systems we experiment with. When the systems are utilized, user interaction is recorded in event logs. After applying process mining methods to these logs, process and user interface flow models are automatically derived. These resulting models provide insight regarding the real usage of the software, motivate the changes in the functional specifications, enable usability improvements and software redesign.Thus, with the help of our examples we demonstrate that process mining facilitates new forms of software analysis. The user interaction with almost every software system can be mined in order to improve the software and to monitor and measure its real usage.

The events found in these domains typically refer to activities executed by resources at particular times and for particular cases. Process mining provides the means to discover the real processes, to detect deviations from normative processes, and to analyze bottlenecks and waste from such events. However, process mining tends to be backward-looking. Fortunately, simulation can be used to explore different design alternatives and to anticipate future performance problems. This keynote paper discusses the link between both types of analysis and elaborates on the challenges process discovery techniques are facing. Quality notions such as recall, precision, and generalization are discussed. Rather than introducing a specific process discovery or conformance checking algorithm, the paper provides a comprehensive set of conformance propositions. These conformance propositions serve two purposes: (1) introducing the essence of process mining by discussing the relation between event logs and process models, and (2) discussing possible requirements for the quantification of quality notions related to recall, precision, and generalization.

While the benefits of process mining are widely acknowledged, many people rightfully have concerns about irresponsible uses of personal data. Healthcare information systems contain highly sensitive information and healthcare regulations often require protection of data privacy. The need to comply with strict privacy requirements may result in a decreased data utility for analysis. Until recently, data privacy issues did not get much attention in the process mining community; however, several privacy-preserving data transformation techniques have been proposed in the data mining community. Many similarities between data mining and process mining exist, but there are key differences that make privacy-preserving data mining techniques unsuitable to anonymise process data (without adaptations). In this article, we analyse data privacy and utility requirements for healthcare process data and assess the suitability of privacy-preserving data transformation methods to anonymise healthcare data. We demonstrate how some of these anonymisation methods affect various process mining results using three publicly available healthcare event logs. We describe a framework for privacy-preserving process mining that can support healthcare process mining analyses. We also advocate the recording of privacy metadata to capture information about privacy-preserving transformations performed on an event log.

The automation of manufacturing requires operators to adopt new techniques and shifts the focus from lowcomplexity repetitive tasks to dealing with the execution of highcomplexity tasks in cooperation with machines. The emergence of wearable technologies makes it possible to equip operators with miniaturized sensors that may be used to determine the physical and mental stress experienced by operators. Process mining technologies are suited to analyze such sensor data in the context of the manufacturing process with the ultimate goal of improving the operator\u2019s well-being through re-organization of work and the work place. However, the storage and processing of such highly personalized data comes with many privacy challenges. Whereas there are many potential benefits, such as improve the work environment, there are also many justified reasons for operators to oppose the processing of their data. Apart from employee concerns, data protection regulations, such as EU GDPR (Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation), imposes many compliance challenges for the design of a process mining systems dealing with personal data. We contribute an analysis of the privacy challenges of using process mining on data recorded from sensorized operators in human-centered industrial environments. Guided by privacy research and the regulation imposed by the GDPR, we describe guidelines for privacy in process mining systems.

Prediction is challenging when cases are not isolated but influence each other by competing for resources (spaces, machines, operators). The so-called performance spectrum maps a variety of performance-related measures within and across cases over time. We propose a novel prediction approach that uses the performance spectrum for feature selection and extraction to pose machine learning problems used for performance prediction in non-isolated cases. Although the approach is general, we focus on material handling systems as a primary example. We report on a feasibility study conducted for the material handling systems of a major European airport. The results show that the use of the performance spectrum enables much better predictions than baseline approaches.

The goal is to extract process related knowledge from event data stored in information systems. One of the most challenging process mining tasks is process discovery, i.e., the automatic construction of process models from raw event logs. Today there are dozens of process discovery techniques generating process models using different notations (Petri nets, EPCs, BPMN, heuristic nets, etc.). This paper focuses on the representational bias used by these techniques. We will show that the choice of target model is very important for the discovery process itself. The representational bias should not be driven by the desired graphical representation but by the characteristics of the underlying processes and process discovery techniques. Therefore, we analyze the role of the representational bias in process mining. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.

Process mining techniques enable process-centric analysis of data, including automatically discovering process models and checking if event data conform to a certain model. In this paper we analyze the previously unexplored setting of uncertain event logs: logs where quantified uncertainty is recorded together with the corresponding data. We define a taxonomy of uncertain event logs and models, and we examine the challenges that uncertainty poses on process discovery and conformance checking. Finally, we show how upper and lower bounds for conformance can be obtained aligning an uncertain trace onto a regular process model.

Monitoring and redesigning processes can foster the success of health care institutions, enabling them to provide a quality service while simultaneously reducing costs. Process mining, a discipline that extracts knowledge from information system data to analyze operational processes, affords an opportunity to understand health care processes. Objective: Health care processes are highly flexible and multidisciplinary, and health care professionals are able to coordinate in a variety of different ways to treat a diagnosis. The aim of this work was to understand whether the ways in which professionals coordinate their work affect the clinical outcome of patients. Methods: This paper proposes a method based on the use of process mining to identify patterns of collaboration between physician, nurse, and dietitian in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to compare these patterns with the clinical evolution of the patients within the context of primary care. Clustering is used as part of the preprocessing of data to manage the variability, and then process mining is used to identify patterns that may arise. Results: The method is applied in three primary health care centers in Santiago, Chile. A total of seven collaboration patterns were identified, which differed primarily in terms of the number of disciplines present, the participation intensity of each discipline, and the referrals between disciplines. The pattern in which the three disciplines participated in the most equitable and comprehensive manner had a lower proportion of highly decompensated patients compared with those patterns in which the three disciplines participated in an unbalanced manner. Conclusions: By discovering which collaboration patterns lead to improved outcomes, health care centers can promote the most successful patterns among their professionals so as to improve the treatment of patients. Process mining techniques are useful for discovering those collaborations patterns in flexible and unstructured health care processes.

However, extracting data that allows analysing the process view from blockchains is surprisingly hard. Therefore, blockchain data are rarely used for process mining. In this paper, we propose a framework for alleviating that pain. The framework comprises three main parts: a manifest specifying how data is logged, an extractor for retrieving data (structured according to the XES standard), and a generator that produces logging code to support smart contract developers. Among others, we propose a convenient way to encode logging data in a compact form, to achieve relatively low cost and high throughput for on-chain logging. The proposal is evaluated with logs created from generated logging code, as well as with existing blockchain applications that do not make use of the proposed code generator. A case study was conducted in an IT organization that uses Jira Software to manage its projects. With process mining, it was possible to extract the work\ufb02ow behaviour in two different projects. While Scrum standards like role distribution could be discovered, other practices like customer collaboration could not be detected in the log. This case study provided important insights regarding the application of process mining in case-handling systems and Scrum processes.

The data, collected through radio-frequency identification scanners, cover one skiing season with approximately 1.2 million recorded ski lift transportations. Cluster analysis was performed on ten subsamples, and the obtained clusters were cross-validated. Several types of skier behavior were found. Temporal clustering revealed that skier patterns differ according to time of maximal performance and length of stay in the ski lift transportation system. Spatial clustering revealed that it is reasonable to have as many clusters as ski lifts in a ski resort, since skiers tend to choose a dominant ski lift during a skier-day. The detected patterns reveal valuable information that can be used for potential improvement of products and services offered by ski resorts.

A process mining algorithm can generally discover the process model of an organization without considering the detailed process models of the departments, and the relationship among departments. The exchange of messages among departments can produce asynchronous activities among department process models. The event logs from departments can be considered as multi-source logs, which cause difficulties in mining the process model. Discovering process models from multi-source logs is still in the state of the art, therefore this paper proposes a hierarchy high-to-low process mining approach to discover the process model from a complex multi-source and heterogeneous event logs collected from distributed departments. The proposed method involves three steps; i.e. firstly a high level process model is developed; secondly a separate low level process model is discovered from multi-source logs; finally the Petri net refinement operation is used to integrate the discovered process models. The refinement operation replaced the abctract transitions of a high level process model with the corresponding low level process models. Multi-source event logs from several departments of a yarn manufacturing were used in the computational study, and the results showed that the proposed method combined with the modified time-based heuristics miner could discover a correct parallel process business model containing XOR, AND, and OR relations.

Process mining can be used to systematically drive innovation in a digitalized world. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process-mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict per-formance, and to guide users towards \" better \" processes. Dozens (if not hundreds) of process-mining techniques are available and their value has been proven in many case studies. However, process mining stands or falls with the availability of event logs. Existing techniques assume that events are clearly defined and refer to precisely one case (i.e. process instance) and one activity (i.e., step in the process). Although there are systems that directly generate such event logs (e.g., BPM\/WFM sys-tems), most information systems do not record events explicitly. Cases and activities only exist implicitly. However, when creating or using pro-cess models \" raw data \" need to be linked to cases and activities. This paper uses a novel perspective to conceptualize a database view on event data. Starting from a class model and corresponding object models it is shown that events correspond to the creation, deletion, or modification of objects and relations. The key idea is that events leave footprints by changing the underlying database. Based on this an approach is described that scopes, binds, and classifies data to create \" flat \" event logs that can be analyzed using traditional process-mining techniques.

In order to enable process mining in diverse environments, the recorded data need to be located and transformed to event logs. The journey from raw data to event logs suitable for process mining can be addressed by a variety of methods and techniques, which are the focus of this article. In particular, techniques proposed in the literature to support the creation of event logs from raw data are reviewed and classified. This includes techniques for identification and extraction of the required event data from diverse sources as well as their correlation and abstraction.

In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained, causing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process models or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and\/or more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and synthetic event data.

In so doing, a comparative evaluation against the traditional automated discovery techniques is carried out to assess the potential benefits that domain knowledge brings in improving both the quality and the understandability of the process model. The comparison is performed by using a real dataset from an Italian Hospital, in collaboration with the medical staff. Preliminary results show that Interactive Process Discovery allows to obtain an accurate and fully compliant with clinical guidelines process model with respect to the automated discovery techniques.

However, one of the major issues of online education is the high dropout rates of participants. Many studies have attempted to explore this issue, using quantitative and qualitative methods for student attrition analysis. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies which (1) predict the actual moment of dropout, providing opportunities to enhance MOOCs\u2019 student retention by offering timely interventions; and (2) compare the performance of such predicting algorithms. In this paper, we aim to predict student drop out in MOOCs using process and sequence mining techniques, and provide a comparative analysis of these techniques. We perform a case study based on the data from KU Leuven online course \u201cTrends in e-Psychology\u201d, available on the edX platform. The results reveal, that while process mining is better capable to perform descriptive analysis, sequence mining techniques provide better features for predictive purposes.

Industry 4.0 concepts with related extensive digitalization of industrial processes enable the acquisition of a huge amount of data that can and should be used for improving processes and decision-making. Utilizing this data requires appropriate data processing and data analysis schemes. In the processing and analysis stage, most often, a broad spectrum of data mining algorithms is applied. These are data-oriented methods and they are incapable of mapping the cause-effect relationships between process activities. However, in this scope, the importance of process-oriented analytical methods is increasingly emphasized, namely process mining (PM). PM techniques are a relatively new approach, which enable the construction of process models and their analytics based on data from enterprise IT systems (data are provided in the form of so-called event logs). The specific working environment and a multitude of sensors relevant for the working process causes the complexity of mining processes, especially in underground operations. Hence, an individual approach for event log preparation and gathering contextual information to be utilized in process analysis and improvement is mandatory. This paper describes the first application of the concept of PM to investigate the normal working process of a roof bolter, operating in an underground mine. By applying PM, the irregularities of the operational scheme of this mobile asset have been identified. Some irregularities were categorized as inefficiencies that are caused by either failure of machinery or suboptimal utilization of the same. In both cases, the results achieved by applying PM to the activity log of the mobile asset are relevant for identifying the potential for improving the efficiency of the overall working process.

Obtaining these event logs is not a trivial task and requires substantial domain knowledge. In addition, an extracted event log provides only a single view on the database. To change our view, e.g., to focus on another business process and generate another event log, it is necessary to go back to the source of data. This paper proposes a meta model to integrate both process and data perspectives, relating one to the other. It can be used to generate different views from the database at any moment in a highly flexible way. This approach decouples the data extraction from the application of analysis techniques, enabling the application of process mining in different contexts.

In recent years, alignments have proven extremely useful in calculating conformance statistics. Most techniques to compute alignments provide an exact solution. However, in many applications, it is enough to have an approximation of the conformance value. Specifically, for large event data, the computation time for alignments is considerably long using current techniques which makes them inapplicable in reality. Also, it is no longer feasible to use standard hardware for complex process models. This paper, proposes new approximation techniques to compute approximated conformance checking values close to exact solution values in less time. These methods also provide upper and lower bounds for the approximated alignment value. Our experiments on real event data show that it is possible to improve the performance of conformance checking by using the proposed methods compared to using the state-of-the-art alignment approximation technique. Results show that in most of the cases, we provide tight bounds, accurate approximated alignment values, and similar deviation statistics.

Conformance checking interrelates the modelled and recorded behaviour of a given process and provides techniques and methods for comparing and analysing observed instances of a process in the presence of a model, independent of the model\u2019s origin. Its goal is to provide an overview of the essential techniques and methods in this field at an intuitive level, together with precise formalisations of its underlying principles. The book is divided into three parts, that are meant to cover different perspectives of the field of conformance checking. Part I presents a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the essential concepts used to interrelate modelled and recorded behaviour. It also serves as a reference for assessing how conformance checking efforts could be applied in specific domains. Next, Part II provides readers with detailed insights into algorithms for conformance checking, including the most commonly used formal notions and their instantiation for specific analysis questions. Lastly, Part III highlights applications that help to make sense of conformance checking results, thereby providing a necessary next step to increase the value of a given process model. They help to interpret the outcomes of conformance checking and incorporate them by means of enhancement and repair techniques. Providing the core building blocks of conformance checking and describing its main applications, this book mainly addresses students specializing in business process management, researchers entering process mining and conformance checking for the first time, and advanced professionals whose work involves process evaluation, modelling and optimization.

On the one hand these systems typically log events (e.g., in transaction logs or audit trails) related to the actual business process executions. On the other hand explicit process models describing how the business process should (or is expected to) be executed are frequently available. Together with the data recorded in the log, this situation raises the interesting question \u201cDo the model and the log conform to each other?\u201d. Conformance checking, also referred to as conformance analysis, aims at the detection of inconsistencies between a process model and its corresponding execution log, and their quantification by the formation of metrics. This paper proposes an incremental approach to check the conformance of a process model and an event log. First of all, the fitness between the log and the model is measured (i.e., \u201cDoes the observed process comply with the control flow specified by the process model?\u201d). Second, the appropriateness of the model can be analyzed with respect to the log (i.e., \u201cDoes the model describe the observed process in a suitable way?\u201d). Appropriateness can be evaluated from both a structural and a behavioral perspective. To operationalize the ideas presented in this paper a Conformance Checker has been implemented within the ProM framework, and it has been evaluated using artificial and real-life event logs.

Given a process model and an event log, the method returns a set of statements in natural language describing the behavior allowed by the model but not observed in the log and vice versa. The method relies on a unified representation of process models and event logs based on a well-known model of concurrency, namely event structures. Specifically, the problem of conformance checking is approached by converting the event log into an event structure, converting the process model into another event structure, and aligning the two event structures via an error-correcting synchronized product. Each difference detected in the synchronized product is then verbalized as a natural language statement. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method can handle real datasets and produces more concise and higher-level difference descriptions than state-of-the-art conformance checking methods. In a survey designed according to the technology acceptance model, practitioners showed a preference towards the proposed method with respect to a state-of-the-art baseline.

In particular, data exchange during the planning and execution of BIM-based projects creates unique demands for the management of data, since the participants involved exchange different kinds of information at various levels of detail according to their individual requirements, and not just once but repeatedly and back and forth. To address this, procedures for structuring, combining, distributing, managing and archiving digital information must be set up and technically supported within a framework for integral model-based project management. It is widely recognized that for the implementation of BIM-based projects and the related collaborative processes, digital collaboration platforms are highly suitable. The British Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 1192 offers a general framework for the implementation of such central platforms based on a so-called Common Data Environment (CDE). The CDE is defined as a common digital project space that provides distinct access areas for the different project stakeholders combined with clear status definitions and a robust workflow description for sharing and approval processes. This chapter presents the technical aspects of the CDE and introduces selected practical aspects.

When analyzing complex databases, these event logs can be built in many ways. Events need to be grouped into traces corresponding to a case. Different groupings provide different views on the data. Building event logs is usually a time-consuming, manual task. This paper provides a precise view on the case notion on databases, which enables the automatic computation of event logs. Also, it provides a way to assess event log quality, used to rank event logs with respect to their interestingness. The computational cost of building an event log can be avoided by predicting the interestingness of a case notion, before the corresponding event log is computed. This makes it possible to give recommendations to users, so they can focus on the analysis of the most promising process views. Finally, the accuracy of the predictions and the quality of the rankings generated by our unsupervised technique are evaluated in comparison to the existing regression techniques as well as to state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithms from the information retrieval field. The results show that our prediction technique succeeds at discovering interesting event logs and provides valuable recommendations to users about the perspectives on which to focus the efforts during the analysis.

For example, a quote-to-cash process in a multinational company is typically executed differently across different countries or even across different regions in the same country. Similarly, an insurance claims handling process might be executed differently across different claims handling centers or across multiple teams within the same claims handling center. A subset of executions of a business process that can be distinguished from others based on a given predicate (e.g. the executions of a process in a given country) is called a process variant. Understanding differences between process variants helps analysts and managers to make informed decisions as to how to standardize or otherwise improve a business process, for example by helping them find out what makes it that a given variant exhibits a higher performance than another one. Process variant analysis is a family of techniques to analyze event logs produced during the execution of a process, in order to identify and explain the differences between two or more process variants. A wide range of methods for process variant analysis have been proposed in the past decade. However, due to the interdisciplinary nature of this field, the proposed methods and the types of differences they can identify vary widely, and there is a lack of a unifying view of the field. To close this gap, this article presents a systematic literature review of methods for process variant analysis.

Existing techniques for process variant analysis detect statistically-significant differences between variants at the level of individual entities (such as process activities) and their relationships (e.g. directly-follows relations between activities). This may lead to a proliferation of differences due to the low level of granularity in which such differences are captured. This paper presents a novel approach to detect statistically-significant differences between variants at the level of entire process traces (i.e. sequences of directly-follows relations). The cornerstone of this approach is a technique to learn a directly-follows graph called mutual fingerprint from the event logs of the two variants. A mutual fingerprint is a lossless encoding of a set of traces and their duration using discrete wavelet transformation. This structure facilitates the understanding of statistical differences along the control-flow and performance dimensions. The approach has been evaluated using real-life event logs against two baselines. The results show that at a trace level, the baselines cannot always reveal the differences discovered by our approach, or can detect spurious differences.

For example, the behavior of resources is often modeled in a rather na\u00efve manner resulting in unreliable simulation models.

To these affected industries belong the construction industry and the logistics industry as well. Digitization cannot only be considered as a threat though. It opens opportunities of overcoming drawbacks and inefficiencies in today\u2019s configuration with the help of emerging technologies and concepts. On taking a closer look at the construction supply chain, a series of challenges to an efficient and smooth operation of processes can be derived. The challenges are then translated into appropriate rules for detecting deviations and violations which again are to be reacted to. By selecting suitable solutions to keep track of the objects of interest in real time, these challenges can be tackled effectively and turned into a transparent process set-up offering end-to-end visibility to the participating actors. Providing the required information to the respective parties in real-time promises a particularly immense potential for efficiency and improvement as it allows them for immediate (re-)action to realworld events. This paper identifies major pain points alongside a typical generic construction supply chain and the related needs for real-time information, proposes viable technical solutions to meet those needs, and presents the improvement potential to be exploited.

The technique analyzes dependencies between data attributes attached to events in order to identify subprocesses and to extract their associated logs.

Traditional techniques in this field generate procedural process models (e.g., in the BPMN notation). When dealing with highly variable processes, the resulting procedural models are often too complex to be practically usable. An alternative approach is to discover declarative process models, which represent the behavior of the process as a set of constraints. Declarative process discovery techniques have been shown to produce simpler models than procedural ones, particularly for processes with high variability. However, the bulk of approaches for automated discovery of declarative process models focus on the control-flow perspective, ignoring the data perspective. This paper addresses the problem of discovering declarative process models with data conditions. Specifically, the paper tackles the problem of discovering constraints that involve two activities of the process such that each of these two activities is associated with a condition that must hold when the activity occurs. The paper presents and compares two approaches to the problem of discovering such conditions. The first approach uses clustering techniques in conjunction with a rule mining technique, while the second approach relies on redescription mining techniques. The two approaches (and their variants) are empirically compared using a combination of synthetic and real-life event logs. The experimental results show that the former approach outperforms the latter when it comes to re-discovering constraints artificially injected in a log. Also, the former approach is in most of the cases more computationally efficient. On the other hand, redescription mining discovers rules with higher confidence (and lower support) suggesting that it may be used to discover constraints that hold for smaller subsets of cases of a process.

Agile focuses on a set of best practices rather than a standardized process, which makes it difficult to assess whether it is being properly implemented in an organization. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of using process mining to evaluate the implementation of Scrum practices based on event logs collected from a case-handling system. A case study was conducted in an IT organization that uses Jira Software to manage its projects. With process mining, it was possible to extract the workflow behaviour in two different projects. While Scrum standards like role distribution could be discovered, other practices like customer collaboration could not be detected in the log. This case study provided important insights regarding the application of process mining in case-handling systems and Scrum processes.

The acquisition of such models may consume up to 60% of the project time. This time can be shortened using methods for the automatic or semi-automatic generation of process models. In this paper, we present a user-friendly method of business process composition. It uses a set of predefined constraints to generate a synthetic log of the process based on a simplified, unordered specification, which describes activities to be performed. Such a log can be used to generate a correct BPMN model. To achieve this, we propose the use of one of the existing process discovery algorithms or executing the activity graph-based composition algorithm, which generates the process model directly from the input log file. The proposed approach allows process participants to take part in process modeling. Moreover, it can be a support for business analysts or process designers in visualizing the workflow without the necessity to design the model explicitly in a graphical editor. The BPMN diagram is generated as an interchangeable XML file, which allows its further modification and adjustment. The included comparative analysis shows that our method is capable of generating process models characterized by high flow complexity and can support BPMN constructs, which are sufficient for about 70% of business cases.

We will show that this approach can be used to evaluate both station operating schedules and the infrastructure of a station. An interval timed coloured Petri net (ITCPN) is a coloured Petri net extended with time; time is in tokens and transitions determine a delay for each produced token. This delay is specified by an upper and lower bound, i.e. an interval. The ITCPN model allows for the modelling of the dynamic behaviour of large and complex systems, without loosing the possibility of formal analysis. In addition to the existing analysis techniques for coloured Petri nets, we use a new analysis method to analyse the temporal behaviour of the net.

In recent years, process mining techniques managed to bridge the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining is used by many data-driven organizations as a means to improve performance or to ensure compliance. Traditionally, the focus was on the discovery of process models from event logs describing real process executions. However, process mining is not limited to process discovery and also includes conformance checking. Process models (discovered or hand-made) may deviate from reality. Therefore, we need powerful means to analyze discrepancies between models and logs. These are provided by conformance checking techniques that first align modeled and observed behavior, and then compare both. The resulting alignments are also used to enrich process models with performance related information extracted from the event log. This tutorial paper focuses on the control-flow perspective and describes a range of process discovery and conformance checking techniques. The goal of the paper is to show the algorithmic challenges in process mining. We will show that process mining provides a wealth of opportunities for people doing research on Petri nets and related models of concurrency.

Involved artefacts establish the basis for a profound enhancement of processes, like performance improvements or a substantiate assignment of employees (resources) to tasks. These artefacts comprise process models for documentation purposes or Workflow Management Systems for executing processes. Those concepts are adopted well within single companies but are barely implemented for inter-organizational processes reasoned in a lack of trust between participating business partners. For instance, questions like who the host of the workflow engine is and thus have sovereignty over the process execution remains open. Besides expensive third parties, we believe that Blockchain Technology bears potential to solve the lack of trust due to automated consensus finding. We present a Blockchain-based process engine guaranteeing a tamper-proof execution, which is both, highly scalable regarding the size of process models as well as capable of considering employees captured in the organizational perspective of the process model. Comparable approaches suffer from lack of trustworthiness either, are not applicable for large process models, or do not include organisational concerns.

Process discovery, as a field of process mining, aims to give a process model that describes a process given by an event log. A process model describes an underlying process well if it contains all behavior relevant (fitness) and if it does not model behavior that is not contained in the event log (precision). The Inductive Miner (IM) family provides algorithms to find process models on complex event logs efficiently and in an easy-to-understand process model representation using process trees. Due to its characteristics, the IM family is one of the state-of-the-art discovery algorithms and is implemented in software of market-leading process mining vendors. Nevertheless, process trees and in particular those discovered by the IM can have imprecise parts. In this work, we combine existing work and present an approach that replaces such parts with more precise parts while preserving fitness. In addition, we demonstrate the frameworks applicability and utilization by improving process trees discovered by the IM, using the IM itself. Further , guarantees on the preservation of fitness and precision are given. Our experiments clearly show that our techniques can be applied to real-life event logs and that they lead to an improvement in precision.

For example, BPS allows us to estimate what would be the cycle time of a process if one or more resources became unavailable. The starting point of BPS is a process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model). BPS models may be manually designed, based on information collected from stakeholders and empirical observations, or automatically discovered from execution data. Regardless of its origin, a key question when using a BPS model is how to assess its quality. In this paper, we propose a collection of measures to evaluate the quality of a BPS model w.r.t. its ability to replicate the observed behavior of the process. We advocate an approach whereby different measures tackle different process perspectives. We evaluate the ability of the proposed measures to discern the impact of modifications to a BPS model, and their ability to uncover the relative strengths and weaknesses of two approaches for automated discovery of BPS models. The evaluation shows that the measures not only capture how close a BPS model is to the observed behavior, but they also help us to identify sources of discrepancies.

Process discovery techniques work with the aim of finding a model from the logs that can accurately describe the observed behaviour. The process model\u2019s fitness increases with the amount of data it can capture. However, due to the very complex event log, the resulting output is a complex web-like unstructured model, also known as the spaghetti model. Resolving this into a simple model, also known as the lasagna model, is critical to the process model\u2019s comprehensibility. Range filtering is one of the methods suggested to address the issue with unstructured models. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of a multi-range filtering technique for improving the comprehensibility of the spaghetti model. We utilize a Python-based library to evaluate multirange filtering on BPI challenge 2013 and clinical dataset. Process conformance is measured using various quality measures such as fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity by applying alpha, inductive, and heuristic mining algorithms. The analysis suggests that multi-range filtering techniques produce models that can significantly vary in quality and deviate from generally perceived notions about these algorithms. We conclude that data preprocessing, like cohort analysis, would be helpful before applying any filtering technique. Furthermore, regionbased mining algorithms may provide a lossless way to improve comprehensibility. \u00a9 by authors.","Date":"2023","DateAdded":"2023-11-05 18:08:41","DateModified":"2023-11-05 18:16:25","AccessDate":"2023-11-05","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\5XPQ6XHJ\\Singh et al. - 2023 - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-Filtering Te.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Discovery","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"XHB2482N","ItemType":"preprint","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"Graves, Nina; Koren, Istv\u00e1n; Rafiei, Majid; van der Aalst, Wil M.P.","Title":"From Identities to Quantities: Introducing Items and Decoupling Points to Object-centric Process Mining","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/375238938_From_Identities_to_Quantities_Introducing_Items_and_Decoupling_Points_to_Object-centric_Process_Mining","AbstractNote":"Logistics processes ensure that the right product is at the right location at the right time in the right quantity. Their efficiency is crucial to industrial operations, as they generate costs while not adding value to the product. Process mining techniques improve processes using real-life data. However, the application of process mining to logistics processes poses several challenges, as (1) recorded material movements refer to quantities of items, not individual objects and (2) the required data are often scattered over several systems requiring additional pre-processing efforts. This work presents the concept of item quantities to describe the movement of not individually identifiable items across distributed processes. Subsequently, we introduce a framework to integrate the explicit consideration of item quantities into process mining, consisting of a quantity-related event log and an extension of object-centric Petri nets as a basis for quantity-dependent process analysis. The analysis of an artificial event log demonstrates the additional insights the consideration of quantities uncovers and highlights the potential for the application of process mining in the logistics domain.","Date":"2023","DateAdded":"2023-11-05 22:12:58","DateModified":"2023-11-05 22:17:51","AccessDate":"2023-11-05","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":null,"CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\LNVN783W\\Graves et al. - 2023 - From Identities to Quantities Introducing Items a.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Object-centric Process Mining; Petri Nets; Material Handling; Logistics; Supply Chain","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"NWJZJZVH","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2024.0,"Author":"Schuster, Daniel; Zerbato, Francesca; Van Zelst, Sebastiaan J.; Van Der Aalst, Wil M.P.","Title":"Defining and visualizing process execution variants from partially ordered event data","PublicationTitle":"Information Sciences","ISBN":null,"ISSN":"00200255","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ins.2023.119958","Url":"https:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0020025523015438","AbstractNote":"The execution of operational processes generates event data stored in enterprise information systems.

We focus on visualizing variants describing process executions that are control flow equivalent. Such variants are an integral concept for process mining and are used, for instance, for data exploration and filtering. We propose high-level and low-level variants covering different levels of abstraction and present corresponding visualizations. Compared to existing variant visualizations, we support partially ordered event data and allow for heterogeneous temporal information per event, i.e., we support both time intervals and time points. We evaluate our contributions using automated experiments showing practical applicability to real-life event data. Finally, we present a user study indicating significantly improved usefulness and ease of use of the proposed high-level variant visualization compared to existing variant visualizations for typical analysis tasks.

Traditionally, most BPM decisions and activities are undertaken by business stakeholders based on manual data collection and analysis techniques. This is time-consuming and potentially leads to suboptimal decisions, as only a restricted subset of data and options are considered. Over the past decades, a rich set of data-driven techniques has emerged to support and automate various activities and decisions across the BPM lifecycle, particularly within the process mining field. More recently, the uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for BPM has led to a range of approaches for proactive business process monitoring. Given their common data requirements and overlapping goals, process mining and AI-driven approaches to business process optimization are converging. This convergence is leading to a promising emerging concept, which we call               (AI-)augmented process execution               : a collection of data analytics and artificial intelligence methods for continuous and automated improvement and adaptation of business processes. This article gives an outline of research at the intersection between process mining and AI-driven process optimization, classifies the researched techniques based on their scope and objectives, and positions augmented process execution as an additional layer on top of this stack.

An expanding range of organizations using process mining in their daily operation brings a broader spectrum of processes to be analyzed. Some of these processes are highly unstructured, making it difficult for traditional process discovery approaches to discover a start-to-end model describing the entire process. Therefore, the subdiscipline of Local Process Model (LPM) discovery tries to build a set of LPMs, i.e., smaller models that explain sub-behaviors of the process. However, like other pattern mining approaches, LPM discovery algorithms also face the problems of model explosion and model repetition, i.e., the algorithms may create hundreds if not thousands of models, and subsets of them are close in structure or behavior. This work proposes a three-step pipeline for grouping similar LPMs using various process model similarity measures. We demonstrate the usefulness of grouping through a real-life case study, and analyze the impact of different measures, the gravity of repetition in the discovered LPMs, and how it improves after grouping on multiple real event logs.

While there are many tools to support production planning, production control is left unsupported in handling disruptions. The production controller evaluates the deviations and selects the most suitable countermeasures based on his experience. The transparency should be increased in order to improve the decision quality of the production controller by providing meaningful information during his decision process. In this paper, we propose a framework in which an interactive production control system supports the controller in the identification of and reaction to disturbances on the shop floor. At the same time, the system is being improved and updated by the domain knowledge of the controller. The reference architecture consists of three main parts. The first part is the process mining platform, the second part is the machine learning subsystem that consists of a part for the classification of the disturbances and one part for recommending countermeasures to identified disturbances. The third part is the interactive user interface. Integrating the user\u2019s feedback will enable an adaptation to the constantly changing constraints of production control. As an outlook for a technical realization, the design of the user interface and the way of interaction is presented. For the evaluation of our framework, we will use simulated event data of a sample production line. The implementation and test should result in higher production performance by reducing the downtime of the production and increase in its productivity.

Concurrent activities require observing multiple permutations, increasing data requirements, especially for processes with concurrent subprocesses such as hierarchical, composite, or distributed processes. While process discovery algorithms traditionally use sequences of activities as input, recently introduced object-centric process discovery algorithms can use graphs of activities as input, encoding partial orders between activities. As such, they contain the concurrency information of many sequences in a single graph. In this paper, we address the research question of reducing process discovery data requirements when using object-centric event logs for process discovery. We classify different real-life processes according to the control-flow complexity within and between subprocesses and introduce an evaluation framework to assess process discovery algorithm quality of traditional and object-centric process discovery based on the sample size. We complement this with a large-scale production process case study. Our results show reduced data requirements, enabling the discovery of large, concurrent processes such as manufacturing with little data, previously infeasible with traditional process discovery. Our findings suggest that object-centric process mining could revolutionize process discovery in various sectors, including manufacturing and supply chains.

As a result, only a fraction of time is spent actually applying techniques to discover, control and predict the business process. Moreover, current process mining techniques assume a single case notion. However, in reallife processes often different case notions are intertwined. For example, events of the same order handling process may refer to customers, orders, order lines, deliveries, and payments. Therefore, we propose to use Multiple Viewpoint (MVP) models that relate events through objects and that relate activities through classes. The required event data are much closer to existing relational databases. MVP models provide a holistic view on the process, but also allow for the extraction of classical event logs using different viewpoints. This way existing process mining techniques can be used for each viewpoint without the need for new data extractions and transformations. We provide a toolchain allowing for the discovery of MVP models (annotated with performance and frequency information) from relational databases. Moreover, we demonstrate that classical process mining techniques can be applied to any selected viewpoint.

These case identifiers are used to correlate events, and the resulting discovered Petri net aims to describe the life-cycle of individual cases. In reality, there is not one possible case notion, but multiple intertwined case notions. For example, events may refer to mixtures of orders, items, packages, customers, and products. A package may refer to multiple items, multiple products, one order, and one customer. Therefore, we need to assume that each event refers to a collection of objects, each having a type (instead of a single case identifier). Such object-centric event logs are closer to data in real-life information systems. From an object-centric event log, we want to discover an object-centric Petri net with places that correspond to object types and transitions that may consume and produce collections of objects of different types. Object-centric Petri nets visualize the complex relationships among objects from different types. This paper discusses a novel process discovery approach implemented in PM4Py. As will be demonstrated, it is indeed feasible to discover holistic process models that can be used to drill-down into specific viewpoints if needed.

However, in reality, event data often is in an object-centric format where this restriction is violated. Forcing object-centric data into this restrictive flat format can lead to a multitude of problems such as the duplication of events and inaccurate frequency information. To bridge this gap between objectcentric and case-centric process mining, we establish a link between the case-centric data stored in a Celonis Data Model and an object-centric event log (OCEL). We accomplish this by introducing a set of operators that allows us to transform an OCEL to a Celonis Data Model and vice versa. During the flattening process, the exact object-object and event-object relationships can be lost. To combat this loss of information, we let the user induce additional information that they might have about the process into the transformation back to an OCEL. The advantages of transforming flat data into an object-centric format is that it allows for the (re- )discovery of the true object-object and event-object relationships which can help us better understand the process at hand. Furthermore, we propose a new technique to abstract event data on an objectcentric level. This has the benefit that we can incorporate information into the abstraction process that is not available in a case-centric setting and thus end up with more accurate high-level data models. We pack the proposed operators into an intuitive and easy to use UI so that no technical knowledge of a query language such as SQL or PQL is required to efficiently perform the transformation. To test the proposed methods, we perform experimental analysis on a publicly available OCEL and demonstrate that with this novel approach we can attain results that were not previously possible with traditional flat-based techniques.

However, many real-world processes are intertwined with multiple objects, making them object-centric. This paper focuses on the emerging domain of object-centric process mining, highlighting its potential yet underexplored benefits in actual operational scenarios. Through an in-depth case study of Borusan Cat's after-sales service process, this study emphasizes the capability of object-centric process mining to capture entangled business process details. Utilizing an event log of approximately 65,000 events, our analysis underscores the importance of embracing this paradigm for richer business insights and enhanced operational improvements.

However, many processes span multiple organizations, e.g., organizations that form a supply chain or a global production network. In order to improve processes across different parties, one cannot assume a single overall event log. Organizations may not be willing to share event data and may use different identifiers and logging conventions. Federated process mining aims to tackle these problems by creating views on the cross-organizational processes such that analysis is possible. A federated event log transparently maps multiple organization-specific event logs into a single unified representation. Using such a federated event log, it is possible to apply a range of existing process mining techniques and tools. If organizations are not willing to share raw event data, they need to resort to event log abstractions. In such settings, federated process mining approaches merge these abstractions to create an overall view on the process. This paper provides a framework to reason about the different forms of federated process mining enabling inter-organizational process transparency and improvement.

Several works addressed the problem by performing process discovery directly on relational databases, instead of the traditional file based computations. Preliminary results show that moving (parts of) process discovery to the database engine outperforms file based computations. However, all existing works consider the traditional storage of event data which assumes that a clear and predefined process instance notion exists, and that events are correlated to one process instance. In this work, we go two steps further. First, we address the problem of process discovery on object-centric event data which allows several process instance notions to be flexibly defined. We refer to it as multi-process discovery Second, motivated by the intrinsic nature of process discovery that searches for relationships in event data, we address the question of how graph-based storage of object-centric event data improves the performance of multi-process discovery? We propose in-database process discovery operators based on labeled property graphs. We use Neo4j as a DBMS and Cypher as a query language. We compare different discovery strategies that involve graph and relational databases. Our results show that process discovery in graph databases outperform existing approaches.

Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners\u2019 facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios.

To establish such collaborations, which can lead to valuable outcomes for customers, a set of coordinated activities, events, and decision points are orchestrated in business processes. However, due to the diverse contexts of organizations, the meaning of terms used in business processes often differ from one organization to another. Moreover, the way a business process is executed may differ across organizations, in some branches of the same organization, or for certain products or services offered to customers, or even across organizational units. Those differences, furthermore, affect both the performance of business processes and the relevance of performance indicators used for measuring that performance. Therefore, when such points are not taken into account, efforts to enable organizations to learn from each other for performance improvement can lead to three main issues, namely unfairness, inaccuracy, and inadequacy. The aforementioned issues inspire the work in this thesis. In particular, the thesis focuses on providing relevant insights for organizations to improve their performance by learning from each other. With the theoretical Cross-Organizational Process Mining Framework that we developed, that learning becomes possible for organizations. The main contributions of this thesis are five approaches. The approach for automatically deriving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from Ontological Enterprise Models deals with the unfairness issue. Inaccuracy is the main focus of the approach for predicting relevant KPIs for organizations. Identifying the perspectives that can be adequate for organizations to learn from each other is the main focus of the two other approaches: the approach for the automated generation of engaging dashboards and the approach for interactive process performance dashboard generation. The last approach is devoted to building process benchmarks for performance improvement such that organizations can benefit from each others' best practices. Each approach is applied in a real-life setting to show its usefulness and practical value. Overall, the work presented in this thesis provides important contributions to perform cross-organizational process mining in a fair, accurate, and adequate fashion.

However, its potential for significant organisational impact is hampered by poor quality event data. Process mining starts with the acquisition and preparation of event data coming from different data sources. These are then transformed into event logs, consisting of process execution traces including multiple events. In real-life scenarios, event logs suffer from significant data quality problems, which must be recognised and effectively resolved for obtaining meaningful insights from process mining analysis. Despite its importance, the topic of data quality in process mining has received limited attention. In this paper, we discuss the emerging challenges related to process-data quality from both a research and practical point of view.

The approach is implemented as a software tool called Kronos that process analysts can use to upload event logs and obtain analysis results of waiting time causes. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated using synthetic event logs to verify its ability to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in a real-life process.

A user interaction log can be transformed into an event log, suitable for process-mining techniques. If the desktop is captured during the recording process, information about enabled activities is available (next to the executed activity). This information can be extracted and added to an event log, resulting in a so-called translucent event log. A translucent event log can also be extracted from running information systems or created by applying domain knowledge to existing non-translucent event logs. Information about enabled activities is valuable for multiple reasons. For example, one may use this information to discover process models that capture the underlying behavior better. However, until now, only limited work has been done on exploiting the information on enabled activities for process discovery. In this work, we introduce translucent activity relationships derived from translucent event logs. These relationships can be embedded in various discovery algorithms. In this work, we focus on the Inductive Miner. In this process, we derive a translucent directly-follows graph. Based on this graph, we extend the Inductive Miner to use translucent activity relationships. We create three different variants and evaluate them on multiple translucent event logs by comparing them with the Inductive Miner. Based on the evaluation, we show that considering these relationships, fewer recordings are needed to discover a similar, if not even a superior, process model.

However, they do not capture information about activities that could have been performed, i.e., activities that were enabled during a process. Event logs containing information on enabled activities are called translucent event logs. Although it is possible to extract translucent event logs from a running information system, such logs are rarely stored. To increase the availability of translucent event logs, we propose two techniques. The first technique records the system\u2019s states as snapshots. These snapshots are stored and linked to events. A user labels patterns that describe parts of the system\u2019s state. By matching patterns with snapshots, we can add information about enabled activities. We apply our technique in a small setting to demonstrate its applicability. The second technique uses a process model to add information concerning enabled activities to an existing traditional event log. Data containing enabled activities are valuable for process discovery. Using the information on enabled activities, we can discover more correct models.

Process mining techniques allow business users to analyze waiting times and their causes based on data extracted from enterprise systems. However, process mining techniques, per se, do not assist users in identifying redesign options to optimize business processes, e.g. to reduce waiting time. Recent studies suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) may aid business users in various process analysis tasks, particularly in conjunction with process mining techniques. This paper studies how to use LLMs to assist business users in analyzing and redesigning business processes to optimize waiting time. The study compares two methods to prompt an LLM to recommend redesign options to reduce waiting times: (1) a baseline (\u201czero-shot\u201d) method involving a minimalistic prompt; and (2) an enhanced method where the prompt includes descriptions of redesign patterns that may lead to redesigned processes with lower waiting times. To compare these methods, we conduct a user evaluation that combines semi-structured interviews with a survey involving process analysts. The analysts compare the recommended redesigns in terms of desirable properties of recommendation systems, such as relevance, usefulness, and diversity of the recommended redesigns. The results suggest that the enhanced prompting method yields more relevant and actionable redesign options. In contrast, the baseline produces high-level recommendations more suited for managerial decision-making.

We consider customer (process time) and organizational (cost) perspectives. Furthermore, in contrast to most published case studies, we assess the full process improvement lifecycle: pre-intervention analyses pointed out initial bottlenecks, and post-intervention analyses identified the intervention impact and remaining areas for improvement. Using PM techniques, we identified frequent exceptional scenarios (e.g., applications requiring amendment), time-intensive loops (e.g., employees forgetting tasks), and resource allocation issues (e.g., involvement of non-security personnel). Subsequent process improvement interventions, implemented using a flexible low-code digital platform, reduced security briefing times from around 7 days to 46 hours, and overall process time from around 31 days to 26 days, on average. From a cost perspective, the involvement of hiring managers and security screening officers was significantly reduced. These results demonstrate how PM can become part of a broader digital transformation framework to improve public service delivery. The success of these interventions motivated subsequent government PM projects, and inspired a PM methodology, currently under development, for use in large organizational contexts such as governments.

This paper proposes utilizing the AI-Based Agents Workflow (AgWf) paradigm to enhance the effectiveness of PM on LLMs. This approach allows for: i) the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler workflows, and ii) the integration of deterministic tools with the domain knowledge of LLMs. We examine various implementations of AgWf and the types of AI-based tasks involved. Additionally, we discuss the CrewAI implementation framework and present examples related to process mining.","Date":"2024-08-14","DateAdded":"2024-09-29 15:18:32","DateModified":"2024-09-29 15:22:06","AccessDate":"2024-09-29 15:18:32","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"arXiv","Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"arXiv:2408.07720 [cs]","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\F4AZAR4U\\Berti et al. - 2024 - Re-Thinking Process Mining in the AI-Based Agents .pdf; D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\IY9UIKZ9\\2408.html","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Artificial Intelligence; Large Language Model","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":"arXiv:2408.07720","Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"I7NWDVZZ","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2024.0,"Author":"Brocke, Jan Vom; Van Der Aalst, Wil M.

The development of process mining techniques is rooted in process-related research fields such as Business Process Management and fueled by increasing data availability. To cope with the complexity of business processes, the focus of process mining techniques needs to go beyond workflow-like processes, that represent the life-cycle of a single case and enable multiple object types and events. This can only be accomplished by capitalizing on essential concepts from production and logistics domains, such as Bills-of-Materials (BOMs), and Customer Order Decoupling Points (CODPs). Pioneer researchers, e.g. Hans Wortmann contributed to the development of Enterprise Resource Planning, enterprise modeling, product models, and lean manufacturing. Experiences from these fields help to lift the process mining domain from case-based (i.e. workflow mining) to object-centered process mining.

This is an extremely difficult task in the area of production processes, where the lack of a process digital footprint is a very big challenge. To solve this problem, the authors of this article designed, implemented, and verified the results of a new work measurement method. The Workplace Performance Measurement (WPM) method is focused not only on the measurement of task duration and frequency, but also on searching for potential anomalies and their reasons. The WPM method collects a wide range of workspace parameters, including workers' activities, workers' physiological parameters, and tool usage. An application of Process Mining and Machine Learning solutions has allowed us to not only significantly increase the quality of analysis (compared to analog work sampling methods), but also to implement an automated controlling solution. The genuine value of the WPM is attested to by the achieved results, like increased efficiency of production processes, better visibility of process flow, or delivery of input data to MES solutions. MES systems require good quality, frequently updated information, and this is the role played by the WPM, which can provide this type of data for Master Data as well as for Production Orders. The presented authorial WPM method reduces the gap in available scholarship and practical solutions, enabling the collection of reliable data on the actual flow of business processes without their disruption, relevant for i.a. advanced systems using AI.

Achieving such high operational efficiency is not possible without the right methodological and technological tools. Among the potential benefits that the implementation and execution of digital data analysis in a company can bring are improved decision-making quality, increased operational efficiency, a deeper understanding of customers and their preferences, enhanced business security, and improved risk management effectiveness. However, achieving these benefits requires long-term and extensive organizational efforts that encompass organizational culture, work organization, and conscious actions at both the strategic and operational management levels. Digital data analysis in organizations encompasses both data-oriented and process-oriented analytics. The latter, considered one of the most important innovations in the field of business process management, has significant analytical potential for the continuous improvement of processes in organizations, which is crucial for their functioning in a highly competitive market environment. This monograph introduces the reader to both of these topics, presenting opportunities and showcasing effective ways to generate economic value and business benefits from digital data. The monograph is one of the few works on the market that combines content related to data and process exploration, highlighting their complementarity and usefulness for organizations to acquire knowledge that supports decision-making and management processes, aimed at increasing operational efficiency.

The uptake of data-driven approaches in this field in the past two decades, most notably process mining, has created new opportunities for fine-grained analysis of waiting times based on execution data. As a result, a wide range of approaches for waiting time identification and analysis on the basis of business process execution data have been reported in the literature. In many instances, different approaches have considered different notions of waiting time and different causes for waiting time. At present, there is a lack of a consolidated overview of these manifold approaches, and how they relate to or complement each other. The article presents a literature review that starts with the question of what approaches for identification and analysis of waiting time are available in the literature, and then refines this question by adding questions which shed light onto different causes and notions of waiting time. The survey leads to a multidimensional taxonomy of data-driven waiting time analysis techniques, in terms of purpose, causes, and measures. The survey identifies gaps in the field, chiefly a scarcity of integrated multi-causal approaches to analyze waiting times in business processes, and a lack of empirically validated approaches in the field.

A common assumption of GR is that the environment is static. However, in many real-world scenarios, for example, recognizing customers\u2019 preferences, it is necessary to recognize the goals of multiple agents or multiple goals of a single agent over an extended period. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the environment to change throughout a series of goal recognition tasks. This paper presents three process mining-based solutions to the problem of adaptive GR in a changing environment implemented as different control strategies of a system for solving standard GR problems. As a standard GR system that gets controlled, we use the system grounded in process mining techniques, as it can adjust its internal GR mechanisms based on data collected while observing the operating agents. We evaluated our control strategies over synthetic and real-world datasets. The synthetic datasets were generated using the extended version of the Goal Recognition Amidst Changing Environments (GRACE) tool. The datasets account for different types of changes and drifts in the environment. The evaluation results demonstrate a trade-off between the GR performance over time and the effort invested in adaptations of the GR mechanisms of the system, showing that few well-planned adaptations can lead to a consistently high GR performance.

We propose a framework that leverages LLMs for the automated generation and iterative refinement of process models starting from textual descriptions. Our framework involves innovative prompting strategies for effective LLM utilization, along with a secure model generation protocol and an error-handling mechanism. Moreover, we instantiate a concrete system extending our framework. This system provides robust quality guarantees on the models generated and supports exporting them in standard modeling notations, such as the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Petri nets. Preliminary results demonstrate the framework's ability to streamline process modeling tasks, underscoring the transformative potential of generative AI in the BPM field.

This is of special interest in process mining, where event data tracking the actual execution of the process are related to process models, and can then provide insights on frequencies and probabilities. Variants of stochastic Petri nets provide a natural formal basis to represent stochastic behaviour and support different data-driven and model-driven analysis tasks in this spectrum. However, when capturing business processes, such nets inherently need a labelling that maps between transitions and activities. In many state of the art process mining techniques, this labelling is not 1-on-1, leading to unlabelled transitions and activities represented by multiple transitions. At the same time, they have to be analysed in a finite-trace semantics, matching the fact that each process execution consists of finitely many steps. These two aspects impede the direct application of existing techniques for stochastic Petri nets, calling for a novel characterisation that incorporates labels and silent transitions in a finite-trace semantics. In this article, we provide such a characterisation starting from generalised stochastic Petri nets and obtaining the framework of labelled stochastic processes (LSPs). On top of this framework, we introduce different key analysis tasks on the traces of LSPs and their probabilities. We show that all such analysis tasks can be solved analytically, in particular reducing them to a single method that combines automata-based techniques to single out the behaviour of interest within an LSP, with techniques based on absorbing Markov chains to reason on their probabilities. Finally, we demonstrate the significance of how our approach in the context of stochastic conformance checking, illustrating practical feasibility through a proof-of-concept implementation and its application to different datasets.","Date":"2024-09","DateAdded":"2024-09-29 18:11:51","DateModified":"2024-09-29 18:14:03","AccessDate":"2024-09-29 18:11:51","Pages":"102383","NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":"124","NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":"Information Systems","ShortTitle":"Enjoy the silence","Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":null,"Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","CallNumber":null,"Extra":null,"Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\UHGP8SUH\\Leemans et al. - 2024 - Enjoy the silence Analysis of stochastic Petri ne.pdf","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Petri Nets; Markov; Stochastic","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":null,"Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"2ECFFHIY","ItemType":"journalArticle","PublicationYear":2023.0,"Author":"Berti, Alessandro; Jessen, Urszula; Park, Gyunam; Rafiei, Majid; van Der Aalst, Wil M.

It ensures the correct and efficient provisioning of materials and services. An efficient P2P process reduces operational costs by ensuring discounts, avoiding late payments, and choosing the optimal supplier for the goods. Process mining techniques help practitioners optimize the execution of P2P processes by analyzing the execution data and providing useful insights. However, existing techniques may result in misleading insights due to many-to-many relationships between business objects, e.g., between orders and invoices in the P2P process. Recently, object-centric process mining techniques have been proposed to avoid the limitations of traditional process mining techniques. In this paper, we present a case study on a real-life P2P process using object-centric process mining techniques. To that end, we adopt the well-known PM process mining project methodology to the object-centric setting and analyze the performance and compliance.

Object-centric event data represent process executions as event graphs of interacting objects. When applying machine learning techniques to object-centric event data, the event log has to be flattened into sequential process executions used as input for traditional process mining approaches. However, sequentializing the events by flattening removes the graph structure of object-centric event data and, therefore, constitutes an information loss. In this paper, we present a general approach to preserve the graph structures of object-centric event data across machine learning tasks in process mining. We provide two different techniques to preserve these structures depending on the required input format of machine learning techniques: as direct graph encodings or as graph embeddings. We evaluate our contributions by applying three different predictive process monitoring tasks to direct graph encodings, graph embeddings, and flattened event logs. Based on the relative performances, we assess the information contained in the graph structure of object-centric event logs that is, currently, lost in machine learning approaches for traditional process mining. Furthermore, we compare different graph embedding techniques for object-centric event logs to derive recommendations for future research and deployment. To conclude, we assess the improvement that graph embeddings constitute over state-of-the-art approaches that capture object information through specific features. Our contributions improve predictive process monitoring on object-centric event data and quantify the potential performance increases of predictive models. These contributions are especially relevant when looking at real-life applications of predictive process monitoring which are often applied to information systems with relational databases that contain multiple objects and, currently, still enforce flattening.

An important task contributing to redesign is idea generation. It has been argued that the choice of technique influences redesign outcomes, but empirical evidence is largely missing. In this paper, we examine the role of idea generation in business process redesign by comparing two different kinds of techniques: exploitative and explorative redesign techniques. Often, exploitative techniques are expected to yield more appropriate solutions, while explorative techniques are associated with more creative outcomes. To investigate such propositions, we consider the Best Practices of Process Redesign as an example of an exploitative redesign technique and the Business Process Design Space as an explorative redesign technique. We conducted a free-simulation experiment to study the empirical impact of the choice of redesign techniques on outcomes. We find that the Business Process Design Space leads to a higher number of redesign ideas, which are also more diverse. These are more creative and novel than ideas produced by the Best Practices of Process Redesign. Against expectation, the best practices as an exploitative approach do not produce more appropriate nor impactful ideas in our task design. Since both approaches cover different areas of improvement, a key implication of our work is that they should not be seen as isolated approaches to redesign; rather, they should be purposefully combined to not only create novel but also operational business process redesigns.

While process models can be represented in a variety of ways, Petri nets form a theoretically well-explored description language and are therefore often used. In this paper, we extend the eST-Miner process discovery algorithm. The eST-Miner computes a set of Petri net places which are considered to be fitting with respect to a certain fraction of the behavior described by the given event log as indicated by a given noise threshold. It evaluates all possible candidate places using token-based replay. The set of replayable traces is determined for each place in isolation, i.e., these sets do not need to be consistent. This allows the algorithm to abstract from infrequent behavioral patterns occurring only in some traces. However, when combining places into a Petri net by connecting them to the corresponding uniquely labeled transitions, the resulting net can replay exactly those traces from the event log that are allowed by the combination of all inserted places. Thus, inserting places one-by-one without considering their combined effect may result in deadlocks and low fitness of the Petri net. In this paper, we explore adaptions of the eST-Miner, that aim to select a subset of places such that the resulting Petri net guarantees a definable minimal fitness while maintaining high precision with respect to the input event log. Furthermore, current place evaluation techniques tend to block the execution of infrequent activity labels. Thus, a refined place fitness metric is introduced and thoroughly investigated. In our experiments we use real and artificial event logs to evaluate and compare the impact of the various place selection strategies and place fitness evaluation metrics on the returned Petri net.","Date":"2024-01-22","DateAdded":"2024-09-29 18:32:23","DateModified":"2024-09-29 18:33:54","AccessDate":"2024-09-29 18:32:23","Pages":null,"NumPages":null,"Issue":null,"Volume":null,"NumberOfVolumes":null,"JournalAbbreviation":null,"ShortTitle":null,"Series":null,"SeriesNumber":null,"SeriesText":null,"SeriesTitle":null,"Publisher":"arXiv","Place":null,"Language":"en","Rights":null,"Type":null,"Archive":null,"ArchiveLocation":null,"LibraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","CallNumber":null,"Extra":"arXiv:2212.11047 [cs]","Notes":null,"FileAttachments":"D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\CZEFTW3L\\Mannel and van der Aalst - 2024 - Discovering Process Models With Long-Term Dependen.pdf; D:\\OneDrive\\Zotero\\storage\\7F4X4AHC\\2212.html","LinkAttachments":null,"ManualTags":"Process Mining; Petri Nets; Discovery","AutomaticTags":null,"Editor":null,"SeriesEditor":null,"Translator":null,"Contributor":null,"AttorneyAgent":null,"BookAuthor":null,"CastMember":null,"Commenter":null,"Composer":null,"Cosponsor":null,"Counsel":null,"Interviewer":null,"Producer":null,"Recipient":null,"ReviewedAuthor":null,"Scriptwriter":null,"WordsBy":null,"Guest":null,"Number":"arXiv:2212.11047","Edition":null,"RunningTime":null,"Scale":null,"Medium":null,"ArtworkSize":null,"FilingDate":null,"ApplicationNumber":null,"Assignee":null,"IssuingAuthority":null,"Country":null,"MeetingName":null,"ConferenceName":null,"Court":null,"References":null,"Reporter":null,"LegalStatus":null,"PriorityNumbers":null,"ProgrammingLanguage":null,"Version":null,"System":null,"Code":null,"CodeNumber":null,"Section":null,"Session":null,"Committee":null,"History":null,"LegislativeBody":null},{"Key":"CGB9X66A","ItemType":"preprint","PublicationYear":2024.0,"Author":"Schulze, Max; Zisgen, Yorck; Kirschte, Moritz; Mohammadi, Esfandiar; Koschmider, Agnes","Title":"Differentially Private Inductive Miner","PublicationTitle":null,"ISBN":null,"ISSN":null,"DOI":null,"Url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2407.04595","AbstractNote":"Protecting personal data about individuals, such as event traces in process mining, is an inherently difficult task: an event trace leaks information about the path in a process model that an individual has triggered. Yet, prior anonymization methods of event traces like k-anonymity or event log sanitization struggled to protect against such leakage, in particular against adversaries with sufficient background knowledge. In this work, we provide a method that tackles the challenge of summarizing sensitive event traces by learning the underlying process tree in a privacy-preserving manner. We prove via the so-called Differential Privacy (DP) property that from the resulting summaries no useful inference can be drawn about any personal data in an event trace. On the technical side, we introduce a differentially private approximation (DPIM) of the Inductive Miner. Experimentally, we compare our DPIM with the Inductive Miner on 8 real-world event traces by evaluating well-known metrics: fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization. The experiments show that our DPIM not only protects personal data but also generates faithful process trees that exhibit little utility loss above the Inductive Miner.

Stochastically known event logs make these uncertainties transparent by encoding multiple possible realizations for  events. However, the number of realizations encoded by a stochastically known log grows exponentially with its size, making exhaustive exploration infeasible even for moderately sized event logs. Thus, considering only the top-K most probable realizations has been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we implement an efficient algorithm to calculate a top-K realization ranking of an event log under event independence within O(Kn), where n is the number of uncertain events in the log. This algorithm is used to investigate the benefit of top-K rankings over top-1 interpretations of stochastically known event logs. Specifically, we analyze the usefulness of top-K rankings against different properties of the input data. We show that the benefit of a top-K ranking depends on the length of the input event log and the distribution of the event robabilities. The results highlight the potential of top-K rankings to enhance uncertainty-aware process mining techniques.
